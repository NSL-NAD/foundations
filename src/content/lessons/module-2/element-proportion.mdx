# Proportion

<DefinitionCard element="Proportion">
Proportion is the relationship between the parts of a building and the building as a whole. It describes how the size of a window relates to the wall it sits in, how the height of a column relates to its width, and how the dimensions of a room relate to each other. Proportion is often guided by mathematical ratios, such as the golden section, that have been used by architects and artists for centuries.

## Why It Matters

Good proportion makes spaces feel harmonious, natural, and comfortable. When proportions are well-considered, a building simply feels "right," even if you cannot immediately explain why. Poor proportion, on the other hand, creates unease. A room that is too narrow for its height feels like a slot canyon. A doorway that is too wide for its frame feels unfinished. Proportion operates on your perception quietly but powerfully.

## The Golden Ratio

The golden ratio, approximately 1:1.618, appears throughout nature in the spiral of a seashell, the branching of a tree, and the proportions of the human body. Architects and designers have drawn on this ratio for thousands of years to create compositions that feel balanced and pleasing.

In practice, the golden ratio is not a strict rule but a guiding principle. It shows up in the proportions of classical Greek temples, Renaissance facades, and even many modern buildings. When you see a building that feels effortlessly balanced, there is a good chance its proportions echo this natural relationship.

## Classical Proportioning Systems

Throughout history, architects have developed formal systems to guide proportion:

- **The Classical Orders** (Doric, Ionic, Corinthian) each prescribed specific ratios between column height, diameter, and spacing. These systems ensured visual coherence across entire building facades.
- **The Modulor**, developed by Le Corbusier in the twentieth century, was a proportioning system based on the dimensions of the human body and the golden ratio. It was designed to bring human-centered harmony to modern architecture.
- **The Tatami Mat** in Japanese architecture serves as a proportional module. Room sizes are defined by the number of mats they contain, creating a consistent and harmonious spatial rhythm throughout a building.

## Proportion in Everyday Design

You do not need to memorize mathematical formulas to use proportion well. Start by training your eye. Look at windows, doors, and rooms and ask yourself: does this feel balanced? Does the height feel right relative to the width? Does the opening feel generous or pinched?

Over time, you will develop an intuitive sense for proportion that will guide your design decisions more reliably than any formula.

## Try It

<DrawerPath>
Sketch two doorways side by side. Make the first one tall and narrow, with proportions that feel grand and elegant. Make the second one short and wide, with proportions that feel cramped or squat. Notice how shifting the ratio of height to width changes your entire perception of the opening. This is proportion at work.

<BriefPath>
Describe two doorways in writing. The first is tall and narrow — grand and elegant. The second is short and wide — cramped and squat. How does each make you feel as you imagine walking through it? Write a short paragraph comparing the two experiences.
