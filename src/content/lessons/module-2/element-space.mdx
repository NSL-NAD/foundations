# Space

## Definition

Space is the void between physical elements. It is the stage for movement, gathering, resting, and experiencing. While we often focus on the walls, roofs, and columns of a building, it is the space they define that people actually inhabit. Space is where life happens.

## Why It Matters

All architecture, at its core, shapes and defines space. A well-designed space gives structure to human activity. It tells you where to walk, where to pause, where to gather, and where to find solitude. Without a thoughtful approach to space, even the most beautiful materials and forms will fall flat.

Think about the difference between a cramped hallway and a soaring cathedral nave. Both are enclosed volumes of air, but they produce entirely different experiences. The hallway pushes you forward. The cathedral invites you to stop, look up, and breathe. That difference is the power of space.

## How Space Is Shaped

Space does not exist on its own. It is defined and given character by the physical elements that surround it:

- **Walls** create boundaries, separating one space from another and controlling what you can see and where you can go.
- **Floors** establish the ground plane, the surface you stand on. Changes in floor level, material, or texture signal transitions between different spatial zones.
- **Ceilings** define the overhead boundary. A low ceiling compresses space and creates intimacy. A high ceiling lifts the spirit and suggests openness.
- **Openings** such as doors, windows, and archways puncture the boundaries, connecting spaces to each other and to the outside world. They control views, light, and airflow.

The interplay of these elements determines whether a space feels open or enclosed, public or private, inviting or imposing.

## Positive and Negative Space

Architects often think in terms of positive and negative space. Positive space is the occupied, defined area, such as a furnished room or a walled courtyard. Negative space is the open, undefined area around and between objects. Both are essential. A room packed with furniture has no breathing room; a completely empty room can feel cold and purposeless. Good design balances the two.

## Sketch Prompt

Sketch a simple open space, such as a courtyard or a single room. Keep it basic: four walls, a floor, and some indication of openings. Now imagine how people might move through it. Where would someone enter? Where would they naturally pause or sit? Add a few figures to your sketch to show the flow of movement.

Notice how the proportions of the space, the placement of openings, and the height of the enclosure all influence how you imagine people using it. This is spatial thinking, and it is at the heart of architectural design.
