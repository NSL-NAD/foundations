# Element Preferences: Mini Project

## Overview

Now that you have studied all eleven core architectural elements, it is time to step back and reflect on which ones resonate most with you. Every designer gravitates toward certain elements more than others. Some are drawn to the drama of light and shadow. Others are fascinated by the honesty of structure and tectonics. Still others find the most meaning in how a building responds to its context and site.

There are no wrong answers here. This exercise is about self-awareness. Understanding your natural preferences will help you make more intentional design choices as you begin working on your own projects.

## The Exercise

### Step 1: Choose Your Three

Review the eleven elements you studied in this module:

1. Space
2. Form
3. Proportion
4. Scale
5. Light and Shadow
6. Texture and Materiality
7. Rhythm and Repetition
8. Symmetry and Asymmetry
9. Context and Site
10. Structure and Tectonics
11. Transitions

Choose the three that interest you most. These should be the elements you find yourself thinking about, the ones that excite you or that you feel are most important to creating a meaningful space.

### Step 2: Show Your Elements

For each of your three chosen elements, create a simple sketch that demonstrates that element in action within a building or room. Keep your sketches loose and exploratory. They do not need to be polished or precise.

Some ideas to get you started:

- If you chose **Space**, sketch a room and show how the proportions of the enclosure shape the feeling of the void within.
- If you chose **Light and Shadow**, sketch a window and draw the pattern of light and shadow it casts across a floor at a specific time of day.
- If you chose **Texture and Materiality**, sketch a wall section and label two or three different materials, noting how each one would feel to the touch.
- If you chose **Rhythm and Repetition**, sketch a facade with a repeating pattern and experiment with breaking the rhythm at one point.
- If you chose **Transitions**, sketch a corner or threshold where two materials meet, showing how you would handle the change.

You should end up with three sketches total, one for each chosen element.

For each of your three chosen elements, write a description of a real or imagined space that demonstrates that element at its best. Describe what you see, how it feels, and why it works. Aim for a paragraph each.

### Step 3: Collect Visual Inspiration (Optional)

If you want to take this exercise further, find photographs of real buildings that showcase your three chosen elements particularly well. Look in architecture books, magazines, or online image searches. Save or print the images and annotate them with notes about what you see: where the element is at work, how the architect handled it, and what makes it effective.

Building a personal collection of architectural references is one of the most valuable habits you can develop as a student of design.

### Step 4: Reflect

Write a short paragraph (three to five sentences) about why these three elements resonate with you. Consider:

- What draws you to them? Is it visual, emotional, or intellectual?
- How do you imagine these elements showing up in your dream home?
- Are there any elements you chose that surprised you?

## Why This Matters

The elements you prioritize will shape the character of everything you design. A designer who leads with light and materiality will create very different spaces than one who leads with form and proportion. Neither approach is better. What matters is that your choices are conscious and intentional.

As you continue through this course and begin designing your own spaces, return to this exercise. Your preferences may evolve, and that evolution is a sign of growth.
