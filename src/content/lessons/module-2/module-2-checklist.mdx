# Module 2 Checklist

Use this checklist to confirm you have engaged with all the key material in this module before moving on.

## Core Elements Review

- [ ] I have reviewed all 11 core architectural elements: Space, Form, Proportion, Scale, Light and Shadow, Texture and Materiality, Rhythm and Repetition, Symmetry and Asymmetry, Context and Site, Structure and Tectonics, and Transitions.
- [ ] I can define each element in my own words.
- [ ] I completed the sketch prompts for the elements that interested me most.

## Personal Reflection

- [ ] I know which elements resonate most with my design vision.
- [ ] I have thought about how my preferred elements might shape my approach to designing a home.

## Element Preferences Exercise

- [ ] I completed the Element Preferences mini project, choosing three elements and creating a sketch for each.
- [ ] I reflected on why those three elements appeal to me.

## Seeing Elements in the Real World

- [ ] I am starting to notice these elements in the buildings around me, whether at home, at work, or while walking through my neighborhood.
- [ ] I can point to at least one real building and identify two or more elements at work in its design.

## Ready to Move On

If you have checked off the items above, you have built a strong foundation in the vocabulary of architecture. These elements will continue to appear throughout the course, and your understanding of them will deepen with each new module. Carry this awareness forward as you begin learning about technical drawings, design principles, and the process of bringing a building from concept to reality.
