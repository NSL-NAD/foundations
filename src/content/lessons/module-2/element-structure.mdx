# Structure and Tectonics

<DefinitionCard element="Structure and Tectonics">
Structure is the system of load-bearing elements that keeps a building standing: walls, beams, columns, foundations, and frames. Tectonics is the art and expression of how those elements are put together. Structure answers the question "how does this building stand up?" Tectonics answers the question "how does the building show you how it stands up?"

## Why It Matters

Good architecture reveals how it stands up, making construction an art form rather than hiding it behind a decorative surface. When you see an exposed beam spanning between two columns, you intuitively understand the forces at work: the beam carries a load, the columns transfer it to the ground. That clarity is deeply satisfying. It gives a building a sense of honesty and integrity.

Structure is not just an engineering problem to be solved and concealed. It is a fundamental part of the architectural experience.

## Basic Structural Concepts

Every structure must deal with the same fundamental forces:

- **Compression** - A force that pushes material together. Columns and walls work primarily in compression, carrying loads straight down to the ground.
- **Tension** - A force that pulls material apart. Cables, ties, and some beam elements work in tension.
- **Bending** - A combination of compression and tension that occurs in beams and slabs when loads are applied across a span.

These forces flow through a building in predictable paths, from the roof down through the walls or columns, through the foundations, and into the ground. Understanding this flow of forces is the beginning of structural thinking.

## Structural Systems

Over thousands of years, builders have developed several fundamental structural systems:

- **Post and beam** - The simplest system: vertical posts support horizontal beams. This creates open spans and a clear, rhythmic structure.
- **Load-bearing walls** - Thick walls carry the weight of floors and roof directly. This system is strong and durable but limits the size and placement of openings.
- **Frame structures** - A skeleton of columns and beams (in steel, concrete, or timber) carries all the loads, freeing the walls to be thin, non-structural enclosures. This system made modern glass curtain walls possible.
- **Arches and vaults** - Curved structures that redirect forces along their curve into compression, allowing wide spans without horizontal beams.

## Structural Honesty

The concept of structural honesty means allowing the structural system to be visible and expressive rather than hiding it behind applied decoration. When you walk into a space and see the timber beams overhead, the steel columns at the corners, or the concrete frame exposed on the facade, the building is being honest about how it works. This honesty creates a powerful sense of authenticity.

Not every building needs to expose its structure. But understanding the structure, even when it is hidden, will make you a better designer and a more perceptive observer of architecture.

## Try It

<DrawerPath>
Sketch a simple beam resting on two columns. Label where the forces travel: the load pushes down on the beam, the beam bends, and the columns carry the force down to the ground. This basic diagram is the foundation of all structural thinking. Once you understand this simple relationship, you can begin to see how every building you encounter solves the same fundamental problem of getting loads safely to the earth.

<BriefPath>
In your notebook, describe in your own words how a simple post-and-beam structure works. Where does the load start? How does it travel through the beam? What do the columns do? Write it as if explaining to a friend who has never thought about how buildings stand up.
