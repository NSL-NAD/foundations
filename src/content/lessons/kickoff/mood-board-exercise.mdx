# Mood Board Exercise

This is the Drawer Path version of your first major exercise. Your task is to create a mood board that captures the overall feeling and aesthetic you want your dream space to embody.

## What Is a Mood Board?

A mood board is a visual collage that communicates a design direction without words. It is not a floor plan or a blueprint. It is a collection of images, textures, colors, and materials that, taken together, tell the story of how you want your space to feel.

Professional architects and interior designers use mood boards at the start of every project. They are one of the most powerful tools for aligning a vision before a single line is drawn.

## How to Build Your Board

### Gather Inspiration

Start by collecting images that resonate with you. Do not overthink this step. If something catches your eye, save it. You can curate later.

- **Magazines** — Flip through architecture, design, and lifestyle magazines. Tear out pages that speak to you.
- **Pinterest** — Create a board dedicated to this exercise. Search for spaces, materials, and moods that excite you.
- **Photos of real spaces** — Photograph rooms, buildings, or outdoor areas you have visited and loved. Your favorite coffee shop, a hotel lobby, a friend's kitchen, a park bench under old trees.
- **Material samples** — If you have access to fabric swatches, tile samples, or paint chips, include them.

### Choose What to Include

Your mood board should capture:

- **Images that inspire you** — Rooms, buildings, landscapes, or even non-architectural imagery (a forest path, a painting, a textile) that evokes the right feeling.
- **Materials you love** — Wood, stone, concrete, glass, metal, fabric. What do you want to touch and see every day?
- **Colors that speak to you** — Not just wall colors, but the full palette of your space, from floors to ceilings to the view outside.
- **The overall feeling** — Step back and look at your board as a whole. Does it feel like the space you described in your vision? If not, keep editing.

### Assemble the Board

You can create your mood board physically (poster board, cork board, taped to a wall) or digitally (Pinterest, Canva, a simple slide deck). There is no wrong format. What matters is that looking at it gives you a clear, immediate sense of the space you are working toward.

## Tips for a Strong Mood Board

1. **Aim for 10 to 20 images.** Enough to establish a direction, not so many that the message gets lost.
2. **Look for patterns.** After collecting, notice what keeps appearing. That repetition is your instinct telling you something.
3. **Include contrast.** A mood board that is all one tone can feel flat. Add a few images that provide energy or tension.
4. **Trust your gut.** If you are drawn to something but cannot explain why, include it. The why will reveal itself later.

## What to Do With It

<DrawerPath>Save or photograph your completed mood board and keep it with your course materials. You will revisit it in later modules when making decisions about materials, color, and spatial character. This board is your north star.</DrawerPath>

<BriefPath>Create a **Written Vision Collage** in your notebook. Collect 5-10 reference images (from magazines, Pinterest, or photos) and write a 2-3 sentence annotation for each explaining what draws you to it — the colors, textures, spatial qualities, or feelings it evokes. Organize them by theme: spaces, materials, atmosphere, and lifestyle.</BriefPath>
