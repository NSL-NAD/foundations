# Dream Home Discovery Workshop

Welcome to the Dream Home Discovery Workshop. This is where everything begins. Before you learn about floor plans, structural systems, or design styles, you need to answer a deceptively simple question: what do you actually want your space to feel like?

## What This Workshop Is About

The goal of this workshop is to guide you through a reflective process that defines your dream home vision. Not a floor plan. Not a budget spreadsheet. A vision — the feelings, experiences, and intentions that will shape every design decision you make throughout this course.

You will work through a series of prompts and exercises designed to help you identify your design intentions. We will explore questions like:

- **Where** do you imagine yourself living — city, suburb, countryside, coast?
- **What feelings** do you want your home to create — calm, energy, warmth, openness?
- **What features** matter most to you — natural light, outdoor connection, a chef's kitchen, a quiet reading nook?
- **How much space** do you need, and how do you actually use it day to day?
- **Who shares your space**, and how does that shape what you need?

These are not architectural questions yet. They are life questions. And the answers will become the foundation for everything architectural that follows.

## How It Works

You will use the **Dream Home Vision Worksheet** (available as a downloadable PDF) to capture your responses. The workshop includes reflection questions, a mood board or sketch prompt (depending on your chosen path), and space for freewriting about the kind of life you want your home to support.

By the end, you will have a guiding vision document that you can reference throughout the entire course. Every time you face a design decision later on, you can return to this vision and ask: does this choice support what I said matters most?

## Who This Course Is For

Before you dive in, a quick word about who belongs here. The answer is: you do.

This course is for anyone who wants to make their space more beautiful, functional, and intentional. You do not need to be building a custom home from scratch. Maybe you are reimagining a studio apartment. Maybe you just bought your first condo. Maybe you are collaborating with a partner on a home renovation. Maybe you simply love design and want to understand it more deeply.

You do not need to be an architect. You do not need to own land. You do not need advanced math or drawing skills.

All you need is curiosity, creativity, and a love of space and design. If you have those three things, you are exactly where you should be.

Let the workshop begin.
