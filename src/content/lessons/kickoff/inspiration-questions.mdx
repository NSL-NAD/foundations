# Initial Inspiration Questions

Before you design anything, you need to understand what you already know about yourself and your relationship with space. These questions are designed to surface instincts and preferences you might not have put into words before.

Grab your worksheet or a blank page and work through each section. There are no wrong answers. Write freely, sketch if you prefer, and be honest.

## The Heart of Your Space

1. **Where is the heart of your space?** Where do you envision the heart of your dream home? Is it the kitchen, the living room, a courtyard, a reading nook? Every home has a center of gravity — where is yours?

2. **What do you primarily use your space for?**
   - Living only (resting, recharging, personal routines)
   - Entertaining (hosting friends, family gatherings, dinner parties)
   - Having fun and activities (hobbies, games, projects, creativity)
   - A combination — and if so, which matters most?

3. **Where are your favorite spaces in your home now?** What makes them your favorites? Is it the light, the view, the furniture, the feeling?

4. **How do you entertain guests? Is this a priority?** Do you host large groups or intimate dinners? Do guests stay overnight? Does your space need to expand and contract for different occasions?

5. **Where do you go for quiet in your home or space?** Does that place exist yet, or is it something you wish you had?

6. **Do you prefer traditional or modern design?** Here is a hint: it does not have to be all or nothing. Most people are drawn to a blend. What elements of each style appeal to you?

## Develop a Design Voice

A design voice is the set of instincts and preferences that make your taste yours. To begin developing it, reflect on the following:

- **Images that inspire you** — What rooms, buildings, landscapes, or scenes do you return to again and again?
- **Words that inspire you** — What adjectives describe the space you want? Cozy, airy, bold, serene, raw, polished, grounded?
- **Feelings you want to feel (more of)** — What emotions does your ideal space generate? Calm, excitement, safety, freedom, belonging?
- **Objects that you like** — What furniture, art, textiles, or everyday objects make you happy when you see or use them?

## Deeper Reflection

Now push a little further. These questions help you identify the specific textures, colors, and references that will shape your design direction.

1. **What materials do you love? What materials do you dislike?** Think about wood, stone, concrete, brick, glass, metal, fabric, leather, ceramic. What do you want to touch, and what do you want to avoid?

2. **What colors inspire you? What colors feel wrong to you?** Think beyond paint chips. Consider the colors of a forest floor, a storm cloud, a terracotta pot, morning light on white walls.

3. **What existing buildings, homes, or spaces inspire your imagination?** These can be famous buildings, homes you have visited, hotels, restaurants, parks, or even spaces from films or books.

4. **What styles of furniture or furnishings do you love? Which styles do you not connect with?** Mid-century modern, rustic farmhouse, Scandinavian minimal, industrial, Art Deco, eclectic? Your answer reveals more than taste — it reveals how you want to live.

## Finding the Essence

When you look at an inspiring photo or space, it is tempting to say "I like it" and move on. But the real value comes from digging deeper. Ask yourself: *What specifically do I like about this?*

Is it the material? The proportions? The way light enters the room? The sense of calm? The contrast between rough and smooth? When you strip away the surface styling — the furniture arrangement, the decorative objects, the color palette — what principle remains underneath?

This is the **essence** of what attracts you. A photo of a sleek modern kitchen might inspire you not because of the style, but because of the uncluttered openness. A rustic cabin might move you not because of the logs, but because of the intimacy of the scale. Finding the essence means identifying the transferable quality — the thing you can carry into your own design regardless of style.

Practice this with every image that catches your eye. Instead of collecting photos, collect *principles*. Over time, you will develop an instinct for recognizing what truly matters to you, and that instinct becomes the foundation of a design that feels authentically yours.

## What to Do Next

Review your answers. Look for patterns, recurring words, and repeated themes. These patterns are the raw material of your design identity. Keep this document with your course materials — you will reference it often as the course progresses.
