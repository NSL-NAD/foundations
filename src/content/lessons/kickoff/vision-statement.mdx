# Vision Statement Exercise

This is the Brief Builder Path version of your first major exercise. Your task is to write a vision statement that describes what your dream home means to you.

## What Is a Vision Statement?

A vision statement is a short, focused piece of writing that captures the essence of your design intentions. It is not a list of features or a wish list of rooms. It is a statement about how you want to feel, how you want to live, and what your space should say about the life you are building.

Think of it as a compass. When you face design decisions later in this course, your vision statement will help you stay oriented.

## How to Write It

### Step 1: Reflect

Before you write, sit with these questions for a few minutes. You do not need to write formal answers — just let your thinking settle.

- **What feelings do you want your space to create?** Calm? Energy? Warmth? Openness? Safety? Joy?
- **What purpose does your space serve?** Is it a retreat from the world, a gathering place for people you love, a creative studio, a launchpad for your day?
- **What inspires you?** Think about spaces you have been in that made you feel something. A cabin in the woods, a sunlit loft, a library with tall windows, a kitchen where everyone gathers.

### Step 2: Draft Your Statement

Write one paragraph — roughly 4 to 8 sentences — that weaves your answers together into a cohesive vision. Do not worry about perfect prose. Write honestly.

Your statement should touch on:

- The **feelings** your home should evoke
- The **values** it should reflect (simplicity, connection, creativity, sustainability, privacy, openness)
- The **goals** it should support (how you live, work, rest, and connect)

### Step 3: Read It Back

Read your statement out loud. Does it sound like you? Does it describe a space you would want to walk into every day? If something feels off, revise. This is a living document — you can update it anytime.

## Example

> "My home is a place of calm and light. It connects me to the outdoors through large windows and natural materials. It is simple but warm, with spaces that invite conversation and corners that allow solitude. It reflects my belief that a good life does not require excess — just thoughtful choices, honest materials, and room to breathe."

Your statement will look different from this. It should. The point is to capture your unique relationship with space.

## What to Do With It

<DrawerPath>Express your vision visually. Create a single-page sketch that captures the essence of your dream home — combine quick drawings of spaces, materials, and feelings with key words and annotations. Think of it as a visual mood page rather than a precise drawing.</DrawerPath>

<BriefPath>Save your vision statement with your course materials. You will return to it throughout the course as a reference point when making design decisions. It will evolve as you learn, and that is exactly as it should be.</BriefPath>
