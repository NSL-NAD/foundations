### 101 Things I Learned in Architecture School
**By Matthew Frederick**

This compact, illustrated book distills architectural thinking into 101 concise lessons. It covers design principles, spatial relationships, and the mindset of an architect in a way that is accessible and memorable. If you read only one book from this list, make it this one — it reinforces everything you have learned in this course.

### The Timeless Way of Building
**By Christopher Alexander**

Alexander explores architecture as a living, evolving art deeply connected to human life. He argues that the most meaningful buildings share a quality that cannot be named but can be felt — a sense of life and wholeness. This book will change how you see spaces and the patterns within them.

### Thinking Architecture
**By Peter Zumthor**

Zumthor writes about the emotional and experiential side of design — how buildings can move us, calm us, and make us feel at home. His essays explore atmosphere, memory, and the sensory qualities of materials. Reading Zumthor deepens your appreciation for why architecture matters beyond function.

### Sustainable Home
**By Christine Liu**

A practical and beautifully designed guide to incorporating sustainability into residential spaces. It covers energy efficiency, material choices, and everyday decisions that make homes healthier and more environmentally responsible. An excellent companion to the environmental design concepts from Module 5.

## Additional Recommendations

### A Pattern Language
**By Christopher Alexander, Sara Ishikawa, and Murray Silverstein**

A companion to The Timeless Way of Building, but far more practical and visual. It catalogs 253 design patterns — from town planning down to window seats and alcoves — giving you a concrete vocabulary for describing what makes spaces feel right. This book directly bridges design philosophy and real residential decisions.

### The Not So Big House
**By Sarah Susanka**

Written specifically for homeowners rethinking the relationship between size and quality, Susanka argues for building smaller but with greater craft and intention. Beautifully illustrated and deeply practical, this is essential reading for anyone designing or renovating a home.

### How Buildings Learn
**By Stewart Brand**

Brand examines how buildings change over time as their occupants adapt them, organized around his "shearing layers" framework — site, structure, skin, services, space plan, and stuff. This book teaches you to think about a home as something that evolves rather than a finished object, and pairs naturally with the structure and materials concepts from this course.

### The Architecture of Happiness
**By Alain de Botton**

A philosophical and highly readable exploration of how built environments affect mood, identity, and well-being. De Botton draws on history, psychology, and art to explain why certain spaces feel inspiring while others feel oppressive. It provides the cultural and emotional context that more technical books often skip.

### Measure and Construction of the Japanese House
**By Heino Engel**

A thorough but visually clear study of traditional Japanese residential architecture, covering spatial planning, proportion systems, modular coordination, and construction details. It offers an important non-Western perspective on many of this course's core elements — rhythm, proportion, transition, and material honesty — and is a favorite reference among design students for its clean drawings and rigorous yet accessible approach.
