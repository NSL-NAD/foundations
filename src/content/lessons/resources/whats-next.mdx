# What's Next?

Completing this course is not an ending — it is a beginning. The skills, vocabulary, and design thinking you have developed are tools you can carry forward into every space you encounter. Here are concrete next steps to keep your momentum going.

## Refine Your Dream Home Design

Your portfolio project from Module 6 is a first draft, not a final product. Continue evolving it:

- Add more detail to your floor plans — interior doors, closets, electrical outlets
- Rework layouts that felt cramped or disconnected
- Sketch alternative versions and compare them
- Explore different material palettes for the same design
- Revisit your environmental diagram with more research on your actual site conditions

## Learn Digital Tools

Begin experimenting with simple 3D modeling tools to bring your hand-drawn designs into three dimensions:

- **SketchUp** for spatial modeling and walkthroughs
- **Rhino** for more advanced form-making (free trial available)
- **AutoCAD LT** for precise 2D drafting
- Even basic digital models can deepen your understanding of how spaces feel at human scale

## Visit Real Architecture

There is no substitute for experiencing buildings in person. Make a habit of:

- Touring local buildings, public spaces, and historic homes
- Sketching what you see — capture proportions, materials, and light conditions
- Observing how people use and move through spaces
- Noticing how materials, light, and flow feel in real environments versus on paper

## Build a Materials Journal

Create a personal collection — physical or digital — of materials you love:

- Photograph interesting textures, surfaces, and details
- Save images of color combinations and finishes that inspire you
- Note where you found them and why they caught your eye
- Over time, this journal becomes a powerful personal design resource

## Research Sustainable Design

Deepen your understanding of environmental design:

- Explore **Passive House principles** for ultra-efficient building design
- Learn about **LEED** and the **Living Building Challenge** certifications
- Investigate **regenerative design** — buildings that give back more than they take
- Study how climate-responsive design varies by region

## Long-Term Paths

Depending on where your interest leads, consider:

- **Continuing education** — Community college classes, university programs, or design studio workshops
- **Working with architects** — Use your portfolio and brief to start real conversations with professionals about bringing your design to life
- **Certification programs** — Sustainable design certifications or residential planning courses
- **A lifelong design journal** — Keep sketching, collecting ideas, and documenting the spaces that inspire you

## The Bigger Picture

Designing spaces is not a one-time event. It is a skill, a language, and a way of seeing the world that grows with you. Whether you design one dream home or many, keep creating, stay curious, and build with care.

Your design journey starts here — and it does not have to end.
