## Sustainability Resources

### Passive House Institute (PHIUS)
The leading resource for passive building design principles in North America. Explore their guides on energy efficiency, airtight construction, and high-performance building envelopes.

## 3D Modeling Tools

### SketchUp Free
A browser-based 3D modeling tool that is excellent for beginners. Translate your hand-drawn floor plans and elevations into simple three-dimensional models to better understand spatial relationships. The official [SketchUp YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SketchUp) has hundreds of tutorials covering everything from first steps to advanced modeling techniques.

### Floorplanner
A web-based tool focused on creating 2D and 3D floor plans quickly. Great for experimenting with room layouts and furniture placement.

### HomeByMe
A free tool for interior visualization. Particularly useful for testing material choices, furniture arrangements, and lighting in a virtual 3D space.

### Planner 5D
An intuitive home design app available on web, iOS, and Android. Create detailed floor plans and switch to a 3D walkthrough to experience your spaces at eye level.

### Sweet Home 3D
A free, open-source interior design application. Import your own floor plan image, trace walls over it, and furnish rooms from a large catalog of 3D objects. Runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

### Blender
A powerful, free, open-source 3D creation suite used by professionals and hobbyists alike. The learning curve is steeper than SketchUp, but Blender offers photorealistic rendering and advanced modeling capabilities for those ready to invest the time.

### Twinmotion
A real-time visualization tool from Epic Games with a free version for non-commercial use. It excels at creating photorealistic exterior and interior renders with natural lighting, vegetation, and atmospheric effects.

## Drawing and Design Tools

### Canva
Useful for creating digital mood boards, presentation layouts, and portfolio pages.

### Pinterest
An excellent platform for collecting architectural inspiration, material ideas, and design references. Create boards organized by room, style, or material.

## Tips for Getting Started

- **Start with one tool** — Do not try to learn everything at once. Pick the tool most relevant to your current need and explore it thoroughly.
- **Use tutorials** — Most of these platforms have built-in tutorials or YouTube guides created by their communities.
- **Combine hand and digital** — Your hand-drawn skills from this course are valuable. Digital tools complement rather than replace them.
