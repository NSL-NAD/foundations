## Tips for Getting Started

- **Start with one tool** — Do not try to learn everything at once. Pick the tool most relevant to your current need and explore it thoroughly.
- **Use tutorials** — Most of these platforms have built-in tutorials or YouTube guides created by their communities.
- **Combine hand and digital** — Your hand-drawn skills from this course are valuable. Digital tools complement rather than replace them.
