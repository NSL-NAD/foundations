# Materials Needed

You do not need much to get started. A few simple tools will carry you through every lesson, exercise, and project in this course. Here is what to have on hand.

## Drawing and Sketching Supplies

- **Grid paper or plain drawing paper** — Grid paper is especially helpful for floor plans and spatial exercises, but plain paper works fine too.
- **Straightedge and triangles** — A basic ruler and a triangle or two will help you draw clean lines and accurate angles.
- **Architectural scale** — Useful for the drawing and plans lessons. If you do not have one yet, we will explain how to use it when the time comes.
- **Mechanical pencil and eraser** — Mechanical pencils give you consistent line weight, and a good eraser lets you iterate without worry.
- **Colored pencils or markers** (optional) — Helpful for adding emphasis, distinguishing zones on a floor plan, or bringing a mood board to life.

## Organization

- **Folder, binder, or digital portfolio** — Keep your exercises, sketches, and notes together in one place. A physical binder works great, or you can scan and store everything digitally. By the end of the course, you will have a personal design portfolio worth holding onto.

## Downloadable Resources

Throughout the course, you will find downloadable PDF worksheets and templates to support your work. Each resource is available for download in the lesson where it is most relevant, so you can grab them one at a time as you go.
