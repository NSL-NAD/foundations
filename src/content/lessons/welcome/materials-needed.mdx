# Materials Needed

You do not need much to get started. A few simple tools will carry you through every lesson, exercise, and project in this course. Here is what to have on hand.

## Drawing and Sketching Supplies

- **Grid paper or plain drawing paper** — Grid paper is especially helpful for floor plans and spatial exercises, but plain paper works fine too.
- **Straightedge and triangles** — A basic ruler and a triangle or two will help you draw clean lines and accurate angles.
- **Architectural scale** — Useful for the Builder's Toolkit Track lessons on drawings and plans. If you do not have one yet, we will explain how to use it when the time comes.
- **Mechanical pencil and eraser** — Mechanical pencils give you consistent line weight, and a good eraser lets you iterate without worry.
- **Colored pencils or markers** (optional) — Helpful for adding emphasis, distinguishing zones on a floor plan, or bringing a mood board to life.

## Organization

- **Folder, binder, or digital portfolio** — Keep your exercises, sketches, and notes together in one place. A physical binder works great, or you can scan and store everything digitally. By the end of the course, you will have a personal design portfolio worth holding onto.

## Downloadable Resources

Throughout the course, you will find downloadable PDF worksheets and templates to support your work. These include:

1. **Dream Home Vision Worksheet** — A guided template for defining your design intentions and goals.
2. **Sustainable Design Checklist** — A reference sheet for environmentally conscious design decisions.
3. **Floor Plan Drafting Grid** — Pre-formatted grid sheets sized for sketching floor plans at scale.
4. **Contractor Q&A Sheet** — A list of essential questions to ask when working with builders and contractors.

Each resource will be available for download in the lesson where it is most relevant. You can print them out or fill them in digitally, whichever you prefer.
