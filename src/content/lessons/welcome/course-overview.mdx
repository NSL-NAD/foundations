# Course Overview

Welcome to **Foundations of Architecture: Designing Your Dream Space** — a comprehensive course that will transform how you think about the spaces you live in.

## What You'll Learn

Over 62 lessons, you'll build a deep understanding of architectural fundamentals:

- **How architects think** — the principles that guide great design
- **The language of architecture** — vocabulary to communicate your vision
- **Practical skills** — from reading floor plans to understanding building systems
- **Your own design** — either a sketched portfolio or a detailed written brief

## Two Learning Paths

This course offers two parallel paths, and you can switch between them at any time:

1. **The Drawer Path** — Learn by sketching. You'll create floor plans, elevations, and spatial drawings that bring your ideas to life visually.

2. **The Brief Builder Path** — Learn by writing. You'll create a comprehensive architectural brief that documents every detail of your dream home.

Both paths cover the same core knowledge. The difference is in how you apply it.
