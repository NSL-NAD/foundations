# Course Overview

Welcome to **Foundations of Architecture: Designing Your Dream Space** — a beginner-friendly course created to help you design your dream home while learning fundamentals to apply to any space. No architecture background required.

## What This Course Is About

This course introduces you to foundational concepts in architecture with a focus on applying theory, technical skills, and sustainable thinking to the design of a personal dream home — or a beautiful, meaningful space of any scale.

Designed for aspiring designers, hobbyists, future professionals, or anyone with an interest in being involved in the design and development of their space, this course serves as both a creative outlet and a stepping stone into architecture.

By the end of the course, you will have developed a technically-informed and emotionally resonant concept plan for your dream home (or ideal space), along with the basic toolkit for the fundamentals of architecture. You will walk away with actionable designs and briefs.

We hope to inspire you to dream big during this process, and we encourage you to push the boundaries or create multiple designs. Perhaps most importantly, have fun during the process knowing you will learn tangible skills that you can implement now to make any space more enjoyable.

## Who This Course Is For

This course is designed not only for those dreaming of building a custom home, but also for anyone who wants to make their existing or future space beautiful and intentional. Whether you are furnishing a studio apartment, buying your first condo, or preparing to collaborate on a home design, this course meets you where you are.

- You do not need to be an architect or own land
- You do not need advanced math or drawing skills
- You just need curiosity, creativity, and a love of space and design

## Choose Your Path

One of the best things about this course is that it meets you where you are. Throughout the course, exercises offer two approaches based on how you like to process ideas. You will see exercises marked with path callout boxes like these:

<DrawerPath>
**The Drawer Path** is for visual thinkers. You will sketch, create mood boards, diagram layouts, and express your ideas through drawing. No artistic skill is required — stick figures and rough shapes are more than welcome.
</DrawerPath>

<BriefPath>
**The Brief Builder Path** is for writers and analysts. You will craft vision statements, written briefs, spatial descriptions, and reflective responses. If you think best when you put words on a page, this path will feel natural.
</BriefPath>

Every exercise in the course shows both options. You do not have to commit to one path for the entire course. Some lessons you might sketch, others you might write. Many students find that doing both deepens their understanding. Follow whatever feels right in the moment.

## Time Commitment

The full course is designed to be completed in roughly **8 to 15 hours** at your own pace. There are no deadlines. Work through the material over a weekend, spread it across a month, or revisit sections whenever inspiration strikes. This is your course, on your schedule.
