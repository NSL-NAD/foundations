# Choose Your Learning Path

One of the best things about this course is that it meets you where you are. Whether you have fifteen hours to spare or just a few, whether you love sketching or prefer writing, there is a path designed for you.

## Two Tracks, One Course

### Essentials Track

The Essentials Track is your streamlined route through the core content. If you are a casual learner, short on time, or simply want a solid foundation in architectural thinking without the deep dives, this track is for you. You will cover every major concept, complete key exercises, and walk away with a clear understanding of how architecture shapes the spaces we live in.

### Builder's Toolkit Track

The Builder's Toolkit Track includes everything in the Essentials Track plus additional lessons on architectural drawings, site planning, environmental modeling, and more technical content. If you are planning a renovation, building a home, or just love going deeper, this track gives you the tools to engage with architecture on a more hands-on level.

You can switch between tracks at any time. Nothing is locked. If you start with Essentials and find yourself wanting more, jump into the Builder's Toolkit lessons whenever you are ready.

## Two Styles of Learning

Within each track, exercises offer two approaches based on how you like to process ideas. Throughout the course, you will see exercises marked with path indicators like these:

<DrawerPath>
**The Drawer Path** is for visual thinkers. You will sketch, create mood boards, diagram layouts, and express your ideas through drawing. No artistic skill is required — stick figures and rough shapes are more than welcome.
</DrawerPath>

<BriefPath>
**The Brief Builder Path** is for writers and analysts. You will craft vision statements, written briefs, spatial descriptions, and reflective responses. If you think best when you put words on a page, this path will feel natural.
</BriefPath>

Every exercise in the course shows both options. You do not have to commit to one style for the entire course. Some lessons you might sketch, others you might write. Many students find that doing both deepens their understanding. Follow whatever feels right in the moment.

## Time Commitment

The full course is designed to be completed in roughly **8 to 15 hours** at your own pace. The Essentials Track lands closer to the shorter end, while the Builder's Toolkit Track with all exercises will bring you closer to fifteen hours or beyond, depending on how deep you go.

There are no deadlines. Work through the material over a weekend, spread it across a month, or revisit sections whenever inspiration strikes. This is your course, on your schedule.
