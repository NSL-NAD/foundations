# Choose Your Learning Path

One of the best things about this course is that it meets you where you are. Whether you have fifteen hours to spare or just a few, whether you love sketching or prefer writing, there is a path designed for you.

## Two Tracks

The course content is organized into two tracks. You can switch between them at any time — nothing is locked.

### 🎯 Essentials Track

The Essentials Track is your streamlined route through the core content. If you are a casual learner, short on time, or simply want a solid foundation in architectural thinking without the deep dives, this track is for you. You will cover every major concept, complete key exercises, and walk away with a clear understanding of how architecture shapes the spaces we live in.

### 📐 Builder's Toolkit Track

The Builder's Toolkit Track includes everything in the Essentials Track plus additional lessons on architectural drawings, site planning, environmental modeling, and more technical content. If you are planning a renovation, building a home, or just love going deeper, this track gives you the tools to engage with architecture on a more hands-on level.

If you start with Essentials and find yourself wanting more, jump into the Builder's Toolkit lessons whenever you are ready.

## Two Learning Paths

Within each track, exercises offer two approaches based on how you like to process ideas. As you move through the course, you will see exercises marked with colored callout boxes:

<DrawerPath>
**The Drawer Path** is for visual thinkers. You will sketch, create mood boards, diagram layouts, and express your ideas through drawing. No artistic skill is required — stick figures and rough shapes are more than welcome.
</DrawerPath>

<BriefPath>
**The Brief Builder Path** is for writers and analysts. You will craft vision statements, written briefs, spatial descriptions, and reflective responses. If you think best when you put words on a page, this path will feel natural.
</BriefPath>

You can do one path or the other, or both. Many students find that doing both deepens their understanding. Follow whatever feels right in the moment.

## How It All Fits Together

Think of the **tracks** as how much content you want to cover, and the **paths** as how you want to engage with exercises:

| | Essentials Track | Builder's Toolkit Track |
|---|---|---|
| **Drawer Path** | Core concepts + sketching exercises | Full course + all drawing assignments |
| **Brief Builder Path** | Core concepts + written exercises | Full course + all written briefs |
| **Both Paths** | Core concepts + sketch and write | Full course + complete portfolio |

The Essentials Track lands closer to **8 hours**, while the Builder's Toolkit Track with all exercises will bring you closer to **15 hours or beyond**, depending on how deep you go.

No matter which combination you choose, you will finish the course with a real design for your dream space and the foundational knowledge to bring it to life.
