# How to Use This Course

This guide will help you get the most out of your learning experience.

## Self-Paced Learning

There are no deadlines. Work through the lessons at whatever pace feels comfortable. The course follows a linear structure, so we recommend going in order, but you are free to jump around if a topic catches your eye. Some students complete a lesson per day; others binge through a module on weekends. Both approaches work great.

## Course Features

Here is what you will find inside each module:

- **Short videos** introducing key concepts and setting the stage for each section
- **Digestible written lessons** that break down architectural ideas into approachable, well-organized content
- **Design prompts and exercises** that let you apply what you learn to your own dream home or ideal space
- **Curated free resources** to explore topics further on your own
- **Project-based assignments** that build toward your final portfolio or design brief
- **Optional deeper-dive content** for students who want to explore further
- **Downloadable PDFs** including worksheets, templates, reference guides, and cheat sheets

## Track Your Progress

As you complete each lesson, click the **Mark Complete** button at the bottom. This updates your progress dashboard so you can see how far you've come.

## Path Callouts

Throughout the course, you will see exercises marked with colored path callout boxes. These indicate two different approaches to each exercise:

- **Drawer Path** (teal) — Best if you enjoy hands-on, visual work like sketching and diagramming
- **Brief Builder Path** (amber) — Best if you prefer writing, analysis, and verbal descriptions

You do not need to choose one path for the entire course. You can switch between them at any time, do one or the other, or try both on any given exercise. Most core content applies to everyone regardless of path.

## Highlight to Notebook

As you read through lessons, you can highlight any text and save it directly to your notebook. Simply select the text you want to save, and a small **Add to Notebook** bubble will appear above your selection. Click it, and the highlighted passage will be added to your notes for that lesson as a quote. Your notebook will open automatically with the cursor ready for you to add your own thoughts or context right after the clipped text.

This makes it easy to collect key concepts, definitions, or ideas as you read without breaking your flow. Your notes are saved automatically and tied to each lesson, so you can always come back to review what stood out to you.

## AI Chat Assistant

The course includes a built-in AI chat assistant that you can access from the tools panel on any lesson. Think of it as a knowledgeable study partner who understands the course material and can help you work through ideas.

The AI assistant can help you:

- **Understand concepts** — Ask questions about anything you have just read and get clear, beginner-friendly explanations
- **Explore design ideas** — Talk through your dream home vision and get feedback or suggestions
- **Clarify terminology** — Get quick definitions and examples of architectural terms
- **Work through exercises** — Get guidance on how to approach a design prompt or assignment

You get **25 free messages** to try it out. If you find it helpful, you can unlock unlimited access from your account page.

## Tips for Success

- **Set up a workspace** — A dedicated spot, even a corner of a desk, helps you focus
- **Keep a notebook** — Jot down ideas as they come to you; use the highlight feature to clip key passages as you read
- **Take breaks** — Architecture is creative work; let ideas percolate
- **Revisit lessons** — Some concepts click better the second time around
- **Develop a portfolio** — Keep your exercises, sketches, and notes together as you go through the course; by the end you will have a personal design portfolio worth holding onto
