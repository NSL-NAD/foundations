# How to Use This Course

This guide will help you get the most out of your learning experience.

## Self-Paced Learning

There are no deadlines. Work through the lessons at whatever pace feels comfortable. Some students complete a lesson per day; others binge through a module on weekends. Both approaches work great.

## Track Your Progress

As you complete each lesson, click the **Mark Complete** button at the bottom. This updates your progress dashboard so you can see how far you've come.

## Choose Your Path

Before you begin Module 1, you'll choose between two learning paths:

- **Drawer Path** — Best if you enjoy hands-on, visual work
- **Brief Builder Path** — Best if you prefer writing and analysis

Don't worry about choosing "wrong." You can switch paths at any time, and most content applies to both.

## Downloads and Resources

Many lessons include downloadable PDFs — worksheets, templates, reference guides, and cheat sheets. Download them and keep them handy as you work through exercises.

## Highlight to Notebook

As you read through lessons, you can highlight any text and save it directly to your notebook. Simply select the text you want to save, and a small **Add to Notebook** bubble will appear above your selection. Click it, and the highlighted passage will be added to your notes for that lesson as a quote. Your notebook will open automatically with the cursor ready for you to add your own thoughts or context right after the clipped text.

This makes it easy to collect key concepts, definitions, or ideas as you read without breaking your flow. Your notes are saved automatically and tied to each lesson, so you can always come back to review what stood out to you.

## Tips for Success

- **Set up a workspace** — A dedicated spot, even a corner of a desk, helps you focus
- **Keep a notebook** — Jot down ideas as they come to you; use the highlight feature to clip key passages as you read
- **Take breaks** — Architecture is creative work; let ideas percolate
- **Revisit lessons** — Some concepts click better the second time around
