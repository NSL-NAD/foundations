# How to Use This Course

This guide will help you get the most out of your learning experience.

## Self-Paced Learning

There are no deadlines. Work through the lessons at whatever pace feels comfortable. Some students complete a lesson per day; others binge through a module on weekends. Both approaches work great.

## Track Your Progress

As you complete each lesson, click the **Mark Complete** button at the bottom. This updates your progress dashboard so you can see how far you've come.

## Choose Your Path

Before you begin Module 1, you'll choose between two learning paths:

- **Drawer Path** — Best if you enjoy hands-on, visual work
- **Brief Builder Path** — Best if you prefer writing and analysis

Don't worry about choosing "wrong." You can switch paths at any time, and most content applies to both.

## Downloads and Resources

Many lessons include downloadable PDFs — worksheets, templates, reference guides, and cheat sheets. Download them and keep them handy as you work through exercises.

## Tips for Success

- **Set up a workspace** — A dedicated spot, even a corner of a desk, helps you focus
- **Keep a notebook** — Jot down ideas as they come to you
- **Take breaks** — Architecture is creative work; let ideas percolate
- **Revisit lessons** — Some concepts click better the second time around

Ready? Let's choose your path in the next lesson.
