# Materials Preferences

This exercise brings together everything you have learned in Module 4 into a single, focused design artifact — your **Material and Systems Concept Board**. This board will serve as a reference for your dream home design and your Module 6 portfolio project.

## Overview

A Material and Systems Concept Board is a curated collection of your preferred materials, finishes, and building systems. It captures not just what things look like, but how they feel, how they perform, and why you chose them.

Think of it as the material DNA of your dream home — the palette from which every surface, texture, and system will be drawn.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Choose Your Materials

Select **5 to 7 key materials** for your dream home. Consider materials for:

- **Exterior walls** — What does the outside of your home look like and feel like?
- **Interior walls** — Plaster, drywall, wood paneling, exposed brick?
- **Floors** — Hardwood, tile, concrete, carpet, stone?
- **Roof** — Metal, tile, shingles, green roof?
- **Key features** — Fireplace surround, kitchen counters, bathroom surfaces?

### Step 2: Create Your Board

<DrawerPath>Create a physical or digital **Materials Board**. Sketch or collect material swatches, images, and color samples. Arrange them visually with labels and annotations showing where each material appears in your home and why you chose it.</DrawerPath>

<BriefPath>Write a **Materials Specification Document** in your notebook. For each of your 5-7 chosen materials, describe: the material name, where it will be used in the home, why you chose it (aesthetic, performance, sustainability, or emotional reasons), and any specific finish or treatment. Also note your building system preferences — heating, ventilation, insulation, and energy.</BriefPath>

You can create your board in several ways:

- **Sketch it** — Draw swatches with labels and notes on paper
- **Collage it** — Cut images from magazines or print photos and arrange them on a page
- **Digital board** — Use Pinterest, Milanote, or a simple document with images and descriptions

For each material, note:

1. What it is (material name and type)
2. Where you would use it in your home
3. Why you chose it (aesthetic, performance, sustainability, or emotional reasons)

### Step 3: Add Systems

Below or alongside your materials, note any special building systems you want to incorporate:

- Passive solar strategies
- Radiant floor heating
- Natural ventilation approach
- High-performance insulation type
- Energy systems (solar panels, heat pumps)
- Water management strategies

### Step 4: Connect to Your Vision

Review your design philosophy from Module 1 and your kickoff vision work. Ask yourself:

- Do these materials reflect the feeling I want my home to create?
- Do these systems support sustainability goals I care about?
- How do these materials work together visually and physically?

## Tips

- **Fewer materials, used well, is almost always better** than many materials competing for attention
- Consider how materials age — some grow more beautiful over time (wood, copper, stone), while others may not
- Think about maintenance — beautiful materials that require constant upkeep may not suit your lifestyle
- Remember the principle of Thoughtful Transitions — plan how your chosen materials will meet and interact

## What to Keep

Save your Material and Systems Concept Board — you will use it directly in your Module 6 portfolio project as Step 5: Materials Board.
