# Tile

Tile is one of the oldest and most versatile decorative materials in residential architecture. From the hand-painted ceramics of Mediterranean kitchens to the geometric mosaics of Moroccan courtyards, tile has been used for thousands of years to bring color, pattern, and waterproof durability to the surfaces we live with every day. In this lesson, you will explore what makes tile so enduring and how to use it thoughtfully in your own design.

## Properties and Character

Tile is a broad category that encompasses several distinct materials, each with its own character:

**Ceramic tile** is made from clay that has been shaped and fired in a kiln. It can be left unglazed (with a natural, matte surface) or glazed (coated with a glass-like finish that adds color, pattern, and water resistance). Ceramic tile is the most common and affordable option.

**Porcelain tile** is a denser, harder variant of ceramic, fired at higher temperatures. It absorbs less water, making it more durable and suitable for exterior use, wet areas, and high-traffic floors. Porcelain can convincingly mimic the look of natural stone, wood, or concrete.

**Terracotta** is unglazed clay tile with a warm, earthy color that ranges from pale sand to deep russet. It has been used in Mediterranean, Spanish Colonial, and Southwestern architecture for centuries. Terracotta is softer and more porous than ceramic or porcelain, requiring sealing to resist stains and moisture.

**Cement tile** is not fired at all. It is made by pressing colored cement into a mold, which produces bold, graphic patterns with a matte finish. Cement tile is handmade, and the slight variations between tiles are part of its charm.

**Zellige** is a Moroccan handmade tile glazed with a glossy, slightly uneven surface. No two tiles are exactly alike, and when assembled on a wall, they create a shimmering, textured surface that catches light in constantly shifting ways. Zellige has become increasingly popular in contemporary kitchens and bathrooms.

## Strengths

- **Waterproof durability**: Glazed tile and porcelain are essentially impervious to water, making them the default choice for bathrooms, showers, kitchens, and any area subject to moisture
- **Design flexibility**: Tile comes in virtually unlimited combinations of color, size, shape, pattern, and texture. From tiny penny rounds to large-format slabs, from subway tile to hexagonal mosaics, the design possibilities are boundless
- **Easy maintenance**: A properly tiled surface is easy to clean and resistant to staining. This practical quality is why tile has been the material of choice in kitchens and bathrooms for generations
- **Thermal mass**: Tile floors absorb and store heat, making them excellent partners for radiant floor heating systems. A tile floor over radiant heat feels warm underfoot and radiates comfort into the room
- **Craft tradition**: Handmade tiles — zellige, encaustic, hand-painted ceramics — carry the marks of the artisan who made them. These tiles connect your home to centuries of craft tradition and bring a human quality that factory-made materials cannot replicate

## Limitations

- **Hardness**: Tile floors are unforgiving. Dropped glasses break. Standing for long periods on tile can fatigue your legs and feet. In kitchens, anti-fatigue mats are often used to compensate
- **Cold underfoot**: Without radiant heating, tile floors can feel cold, especially in cooler climates. This thermal quality that makes tile pleasant in summer can be uncomfortable in winter
- **Grout maintenance**: The grout lines between tiles require periodic cleaning, sealing, and occasional repair. Grout can stain, crack, and harbor mildew if not maintained. The color of the grout significantly affects the overall appearance of the installation
- **Installation skill**: Tile installation requires precision, especially with complex patterns, large-format tiles, or uneven surfaces. Poor installation leads to lippage (uneven tile edges), cracking, and water infiltration
- **Slipperiness**: Some glazed tiles become slippery when wet. Specify tiles with appropriate slip resistance ratings for bathrooms, entryways, and outdoor applications

## Common Uses in Residential Design

- **Bathroom walls and floors**: The most traditional tile application. Tile protects surfaces from moisture and provides an opportunity to create a distinctive, spa-like environment
- **Kitchen backsplashes**: The area between countertops and upper cabinets is a perfect canvas for decorative tile. A bold backsplash can define the entire character of a kitchen
- **Shower enclosures**: Floor-to-ceiling tile in showers is both functional (waterproofing) and aesthetic. Mosaic tile, large-format porcelain, and zellige are popular shower choices
- **Entryways and mudrooms**: Durable tile in entry areas handles foot traffic, mud, and moisture while establishing the first impression of the interior
- **Fireplace surrounds**: Decorative tile around a fireplace adds color, texture, and visual interest to a focal wall
- **Outdoor patios and terraces**: Frost-resistant porcelain and natural stone tile extend living spaces outdoors with durable, weather-resistant surfaces

## Design Considerations

One of the most important decisions in tile design is scale. Small tiles (mosaics, penny rounds) create busy, textured surfaces that work well as accents but can overwhelm large areas. Large-format tiles (24" x 48" or larger) create sleek, minimal surfaces with fewer grout lines, making spaces feel larger and more contemporary. The scale of the tile should relate to the scale of the room.

Grout color is a design decision that deserves as much thought as the tile itself. A contrasting grout (dark grout with light tile, or vice versa) emphasizes the geometry of the pattern and each individual tile. A matching grout (same color as the tile) minimizes the grid and creates a more seamless surface. Neither is better — each creates a different effect.

Consider mixing tile formats intentionally. A zellige backsplash paired with large porcelain floor tiles creates a conversation between handmade and machine-made, between texture and smoothness. A mosaic accent band in an otherwise uniform tile wall adds rhythm without complexity. The interplay of different tile types within a single space can be one of the most rewarding design moves in residential architecture.

The human character of handmade tile — the slight irregularities, the color variation, the evidence of the maker's hand — brings a warmth and authenticity to surfaces that factory-perfect tile cannot match. If your budget allows, consider using handmade tile in at least one prominent location in your home. The difference is one you will feel every time you walk into the room.
