# Budget Checkpoint: Materials and Systems

Material choices create order-of-magnitude cost differences. Understanding these ranges helps you allocate your budget where it will have the greatest impact.

## Flooring (Installed Cost per Square Foot)

- **Carpet** — $3–$8
- **Laminate** — $4–$10
- **Engineered hardwood** — $8–$15
- **Solid hardwood** — $12–$25
- **Tile (porcelain)** — $10–$20
- **Natural stone** — $20–$50+

## Countertops (Installed per Square Foot)

- **Laminate** — $20–$50
- **Butcher block** — $40–$100
- **Quartz** — $75–$150
- **Granite** — $80–$175
- **Marble** — $125–$250+

## Exterior Siding (Installed per Square Foot)

- **Vinyl** — $3–$8
- **Fiber cement** — $6–$12
- **Wood** — $8–$20
- **Brick or stone veneer** — $15–$35
- **Natural stone** — $35–$75+

## Systems Upgrades

- **Radiant floor heating** — Add $10–$20/sf over forced air
- **Geothermal HVAC** — $20,000–$50,000+ premium over conventional
- **Whole-house generator** — $10,000–$30,000 installed
- **Solar PV system** — $15,000–$40,000 (before incentives)

## The Smart Approach

**Splurge on high-impact areas** (kitchen, master bath, entry) and **economize on background spaces** (secondary bedrooms, utility areas). The materials you see and touch every day are worth the investment. The ones hidden behind a guest bedroom door can be more modest.
