# Module 4 Checklist

You have now explored the materials and systems that bring buildings to life. Before moving on, take a moment to review what you have covered and make sure you feel confident in the foundations.

## What You Covered

- **Core Materials** — Properties, strengths, and character of concrete, wood, steel, glass, stone, and brick
- **Sustainable Materials** — Low-toxin choices, natural alternatives, life cycle thinking, and local sourcing
- **Building Systems** — Moisture management, plumbing, HVAC, fire protection, and energy systems
- **Construction and Finishing** — Carpentry, glazing, hardware, masonry, and the details that complete a building
- **Material and Systems Concept Board** — Your curated selection of materials and systems for your dream home

## Self-Check

Before you move on, ask yourself:

- Can I describe the basic properties and best uses of each core material?
- Do I understand why sustainable and low-toxin material choices matter?
- Can I name the five major building systems and explain what each one does?
- Have I thought about how interior and exterior materials meet in my design?
- Is my Material and Systems Concept Board complete with at least 5 materials and notes on systems?
- Am I thinking about how materials affect the emotional experience of my home, not just the practical function?

## Key Takeaway

> Good buildings breathe. They manage moisture, airflow, and energy intelligently — like living organisms. The materials and systems you choose are not just technical decisions. They shape how your home feels, ages, and supports the life you want to live.

Your material choices will carry directly into Module 6, where you will bring everything together into your portfolio project.
