# Timber & Engineered Wood

Where the previous lesson on wood focused on dimensional lumber and the species you might choose for floors, cabinets, and trim, this lesson explores timber as a structural system. Mass timber, heavy timber framing, and engineered wood products are transforming how architects think about building with wood at scale. These are materials that carry the warmth of wood into the very bones of a building.

## Properties and Character

Timber, in the architectural sense, refers to large-format wood products used as primary structural elements. Unlike the 2x4s and 2x6s of conventional framing (which are hidden behind drywall), timber is designed to be seen. Exposed beams, columns, and connections become part of the architectural expression of the building.

The family of engineered timber products has grown significantly in recent decades. **Cross-laminated timber (CLT)** consists of layers of lumber glued together at right angles, creating large panels that serve as walls, floors, and roofs. **Glue-laminated timber (glulam)** bonds layers of lumber in the same direction to create beams and columns that can span remarkable distances. **Laminated veneer lumber (LVL)** and **parallel strand lumber (PSL)** are engineered for predictable strength and consistency that solid wood cannot guarantee.

Heavy timber framing — the post-and-beam and timber frame traditions — predates engineered products by centuries. A hand-hewn timber frame communicates craft, history, and permanence. Whether the timber is traditional or engineered, its effect in a space is immediate: warmth, presence, and a connection to the natural world that steel and concrete cannot replicate.

## Strengths

- **Carbon sequestration**: Trees absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, and that carbon remains locked in the timber for the life of the building. A mass timber structure is, in a very real sense, a carbon storage device
- **Biophilic presence**: Exposed timber creates a powerful sense of warmth and connection to nature. Research shows that visible wood in interior spaces reduces stress and promotes well-being, and large timber elements amplify this effect
- **Spanning capability**: Glulam beams and CLT panels can span long distances, enabling open floor plans and dramatic spaces without intermediate columns
- **Prefabrication speed**: Mass timber components are manufactured off-site with precision, then assembled quickly on-site. A CLT building can go up significantly faster than a comparable concrete or steel structure
- **Fire performance**: Counter-intuitively, mass timber performs well in fire. Large timber members char on the outside, and that char layer insulates the structural core, maintaining strength far longer than unprotected steel. Building codes increasingly recognize this predictable behavior

## Limitations

- **Cost**: Mass timber products are currently more expensive than conventional wood framing, though the gap is narrowing as production scales and the speed of construction offsets labor costs
- **Specialized fabrication**: CLT and glulam require specialized manufacturing facilities. Not every region has convenient access to mass timber suppliers, and shipping large panels adds cost
- **Moisture management**: Like all wood, timber is vulnerable to moisture. Proper detailing during construction, weather protection before enclosure, and careful vapor management are essential
- **Code limitations**: While building codes are rapidly evolving to accommodate mass timber, some jurisdictions still restrict its use in certain building types. Residential projects generally face fewer restrictions than commercial ones
- **Connection complexity**: The joints where timber members meet require careful engineering. Exposed steel connectors, concealed hardware, and traditional joinery each have structural and aesthetic implications

## Common Uses in Residential Design

- **Exposed beams and columns**: The most visible application, where structural timber becomes the defining feature of a room. A glulam ridge beam in a living room or a series of timber columns framing a view can anchor an entire design
- **Post-and-beam frames**: A complete structural system where heavy timber columns and beams carry the building loads, with walls serving only as enclosure. This allows for large openings, expansive glass, and flexible floor plans
- **CLT walls and floors**: Solid wood panels that serve as both structure and finished surface. A CLT ceiling can be left exposed, revealing the warm, layered grain of the laminated boards
- **Timber trusses**: Engineered or traditional trusses that span large open spaces, creating dramatic ceilings in living rooms, great rooms, and lofts
- **Engineered joists and headers**: LVL and PSL products that replace solid lumber in situations requiring greater strength, longer spans, or more predictable performance

## Design Considerations

When designing with timber, one of the most important decisions is whether the structure will be hidden or expressed. In conventional construction, the framing disappears behind drywall. In timber construction, the structure itself becomes the architecture. An exposed glulam beam is not just holding up the roof — it is the room.

Consider the connections carefully. Where timber members meet, the joint can be celebrated as a craft detail (traditional mortise-and-tenon or dovetail joinery), concealed with hidden hardware (for a clean, minimal look), or expressed with steel plates and bolts (for an honest, industrial character). Each approach communicates something different about the design.

Timber pairs exceptionally well with glass. The combination of warm wood and transparent glass creates a relationship between shelter and openness, between the solidity of structure and the lightness of the view beyond. Many of the most celebrated contemporary timber buildings use this pairing to powerful effect.

The mass timber movement is still young, and its application in residential architecture is growing. Whether you choose a full timber frame, a few exposed glulam beams, or CLT panels as a design feature, you are working with a material that connects ancient building traditions to the most forward-thinking sustainable design practices of the present.
