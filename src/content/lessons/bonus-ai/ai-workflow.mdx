# Integrating AI Into Your Workflow

Now that you know the tools, the question becomes: when do you use them? AI is most powerful when it is part of a thoughtful design process — not a replacement for one. The design thinking you have built throughout this course is what gives AI direction. Without it, you are just generating images. With it, you are designing.

## Where AI Fits in the Design Process

Each phase of the design process has tools that match its needs. Here is how they map:

**Inspiration:** Generate mood boards and explore style directions. Nano Banana Pro and Spacely AI are ideal here — fast, free, and visual. Use them to expand your palette of references before narrowing your focus.

**Concept:** Quick visualization of rough ideas. Translate your vision statement or early sketches into images that test whether your instincts hold up visually. Nano Banana Pro excels at this.

**Space Planning:** Floor plan generation and iteration. Rayon and Planner 5D help you move from hand-drawn layouts to digital plans that can be refined, measured, and shared.

**Design Development:** Material and style exploration at a deeper level. Spacely AI lets you test specific material combinations and design styles in photorealistic scenes. D5 Render takes this further with real-time feedback.

**Visualization:** Final renders and animations for sharing your vision. D5 Render produces presentation-grade output, and Kling 2.6 adds motion and video.

**Documentation:** AI's weakest area currently. Diagram generation is limited, and no AI tool can replace professional construction documents. This is where licensed professionals take over.

## A Sample AI-Assisted Workflow

Here is how a complete workflow might look, starting from the work you have done in this course:

1. **Start with your Design Brief** — the vision, spatial requirements, and material preferences you compiled in Module 6
2. **Generate concept images** using Nano Banana Pro based on your vision statement and prompt formula
3. **Refine your floor plan** in Rayon, importing hand-drawn sketches as a starting point
4. **Explore interior styles** with Spacely AI, testing your material choices in photorealistic scenes
5. **Create presentation renders** with D5 Render if you want polished, professional output
6. **Animate for video** with Kling 2.6 to create walkthroughs and presentation clips

You do not need to use every tool. Pick the ones that match your current design phase and comfort level. A single well-crafted concept image from Nano Banana Pro can be more valuable than a dozen mediocre outputs from five different platforms.

## What AI Cannot Yet Do

Be realistic about current limitations. AI is powerful, but it is not a substitute for professional expertise in these areas:

**Structural integrity:** AI has no understanding of physics, load paths, or building science. A beautiful render might depict a structure that would collapse under its own weight.

**Code compliance:** Building codes, zoning regulations, and permit requirements are local, complex, and constantly changing. No AI tool can verify compliance.

**Construction documents:** The detailed drawings that builders use to construct a building — dimensioned plans, structural details, mechanical layouts — are beyond current AI capabilities.

**Accurate dimensions:** AI-generated floor plans and images do not have reliable measurements. Always verify dimensions with professional tools.

**Site-specific constraints:** Soil conditions, setback requirements, utility locations, and microclimate factors require site-specific analysis that AI cannot provide from a text prompt.

> Always verify AI outputs against your knowledge and — for real projects — with licensed professionals. AI is a visualization tool, not an engineering tool.

## The Human Advantage

<CourseQuote>The students who get the most value from AI tools are those who understand the fundamentals of architecture — space, light, proportion, materiality, and human experience. You have built that foundation in this course.</CourseQuote>

AI can help you express your vision faster, explore more options, and communicate your ideas with clarity. It can show you what your words look like as architecture. It can test your instincts in seconds rather than days. But it cannot tell you what to want. It cannot judge whether a space will feel right for how you live. It cannot understand why that particular view from the kitchen window matters to you.

That understanding — the human part — is yours. Use these tools as amplifiers of your creativity, not replacements for it.
