# Integrating AI Into Your Workflow

Now that you know the tools, let's talk about *when* to use them. AI is most powerful when it's part of a thoughtful design process — not a replacement for one.

## Where AI Fits in the Design Process

| Design Phase | AI Application | Recommended Tools |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Inspiration** | Generate mood boards, style exploration | Nano Banana Pro, Spacely AI |
| **Concept** | Quick visualization of rough ideas | Nano Banana Pro, RoomGPT |
| **Space Planning** | Floor plan generation and iteration | Rayon, Planner 5D |
| **Design Development** | Material and style exploration, client presentations | Spacely AI, D5 Render |
| **Visualization** | Final renders and animations | D5 Render, Kling 2.6 |
| **Documentation** | Diagram generation (limited) | Nano Banana Pro |

## A Sample AI-Assisted Workflow

1. **Start with your Design Brief** (from this course)
2. **Generate concept images** using Nano Banana Pro based on your vision
3. **Refine your floor plan** in Rayon
4. **Explore interior styles** with Spacely AI
5. **Create presentation renders** with D5 Render
6. **Animate for video** with Kling 2.6

You don't need to use every tool. Pick the ones that match your current design phase and comfort level.

## What AI Cannot (Yet) Do

Be realistic about limitations:

- It cannot replace architectural judgment
- It cannot ensure structural integrity
- It cannot verify code compliance
- It cannot replace professional construction documents
- It cannot guarantee accurate dimensions
- It cannot understand your specific site constraints automatically

Always verify AI outputs against your knowledge and — for real projects — with licensed professionals.

## The Human Advantage

The students who get the most value from AI tools are those who understand the fundamentals of architecture — space, light, proportion, materiality, and human experience.

You've built that foundation in this course.

AI can help you express your vision faster, explore more options, and communicate your ideas with clarity. Use these tools as amplifiers of your creativity, not replacements for it.
