# AI as Your Design Partner

The world of architectural visualization is changing rapidly. Tools that once required years of training and expensive software are now accessible to anyone with a computer and an internet connection.

## Important Framing

AI doesn't replace the architectural thinking you've learned in this course. It *amplifies* it. The principles of space, form, light, proportion, and materiality you've studied are what make AI outputs meaningful rather than random pretty pictures.

Think of AI as a highly capable assistant who can:

- Generate visual ideas faster than you can sketch them
- Help you see your concepts in photorealistic detail
- Create multiple variations to explore options
- Translate rough sketches into polished visualizations

But this assistant needs *you* to provide:

- Clear direction (your vision)
- Architectural judgment (does this actually work?)
- Design principles (is the space harmonious?)
- Practical constraints (will this actually function?)

## The Goal of This Module

This module will help you navigate the AI landscape, find the right tools for your needs, and learn enough to get started — without recreating tutorials that already exist elsewhere.

We'll cover the major tool categories, walk through the ones we recommend, teach you how to write effective prompts for architectural imagery, and show you how AI fits into a real design workflow.

> As a founding student, you get lifetime access to updates as AI tools evolve. This module will be refreshed regularly to stay current.
