# The AI Tool Landscape

## Understanding the Categories

AI tools for architecture fall into several categories. Understanding what each type does will help you choose the right tool for each stage of your design process.

| Category | What It Does | When to Use It |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Floor Plan Generators** | Create or modify 2D layouts | Early planning, exploring room arrangements |
| **Image Generators** | Create visualizations from text or sketches | Concept exploration, mood boards, early presentations |
| **Interior Visualization** | Transform photos or plans into styled interiors | Design direction, material exploration |
| **3D Model Generators** | Create 3D objects from text or images | Furniture concepts, decorative elements |
| **Rendering Tools** | Create photorealistic images from 3D models | Final presentations, professional output |
| **Site Analysis** | Analyze environmental factors | Advanced: sun, wind, noise studies |
| **Video and Animation** | Bring still images to life | Presentations, walkthroughs |
