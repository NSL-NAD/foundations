# The AI Tool Landscape

AI tools for architecture are emerging across every stage of the design process — from early concept sketches to photorealistic renderings and animated walkthroughs. The landscape is broad and changing fast, so the goal of this lesson is not to cover every tool, but to help you understand the categories so you can choose the right tool for each moment in your workflow.

## Understanding the Categories

Each type of AI tool solves a different problem. Some help you plan spaces. Others help you visualize them. And some help you present your ideas to others. Here is how they break down:

**Floor Plan Generators:** Create or modify 2D layouts. Use these during early planning, when you are exploring room arrangements and spatial relationships. These tools take the hand-drawn floor plan concepts from Module 3 and bring them into the digital world.

**Image Generators:** Create visualizations from text descriptions or rough sketches. These are your concept exploration tools — ideal for mood boards, early design direction, and seeing what your words actually look like as architecture.

**Interior Visualization:** Transform photos or existing plans into styled interior scenes. Upload a room photo, select a design style, and see it transformed in seconds. These are powerful for testing material and color choices before committing.

**3D Model Generators:** Create three-dimensional objects from text or images. Use these for furniture concepts, decorative elements, and custom objects that do not exist in standard libraries.

**Rendering Tools:** Create photorealistic images from 3D models. These are your presentation-grade tools — the final step before sharing your vision with an architect or builder.

**Video and Animation:** Bring still images and renders to life. These tools create walkthroughs, animated reveals, and presentation videos that communicate spatial experience in ways static images cannot.

## Skill Level Guide

Not every tool requires the same level of technical comfort. Here is how we recommend approaching them:

**Start here — Beginner-friendly:** These tools require no prior technical experience. You can sign up and start producing useful output within minutes.

- **Rayon** — Browser-based floor plan tool with AI assistance
- **Spacely AI** — Upload photos, get styled interior visualizations
- **RoomGPT** — Quick room transformations from photos
- **Planner 5D** — Drag-and-drop floor plan and 3D design
- **Google AI Studio (Nano Banana Pro)** — Free concept image generation

**Some learning curve — Intermediate:** These tools produce more polished results but take a bit more time to learn.

- **D5 Render** — Real-time rendering engine built for architecture
- **Hunyuan 3D** — Text or image to 3D model generation
- **Kling 2.6** — AI video generation from still images

**Professional tools — Advanced:** These are industry-grade platforms that architects and designers use daily. They are included here for awareness, not as a starting point.

- **Autodesk Forma** — Cloud-based environmental analysis and site planning
- **SketchUp + AI plugins** — 3D modeling with AI-powered extensions

> You do not need all of these tools. Pick one from the beginner list and learn it well. Mastery of a single tool will take you further than surface-level familiarity with five.

## How to Choose

The right tool depends on where you are in the design process and what you want to produce. If you are still exploring your vision, start with an image generator like Nano Banana Pro. If you have a floor plan you want to refine, try Rayon. If you want to test how different styles look in a real room, use Spacely AI.

The next several lessons walk through our top recommendations in detail — one tool at a time, with clear guidance on how to get started and how each connects back to the work you have done in this course.
