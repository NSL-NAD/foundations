# Exercise: Visualize Your Dream Home Concept

**Time:** 30-45 minutes

**You'll need:**

- Your Design Brief from Module 6 (or vision notes from the Kickoff)
- Access to one of the tools covered in this module (Nano Banana Pro recommended — it's free)

## Steps

### 1. Summarize Your Vision

Write 2-3 sentences describing your dream home. Answer:

- What's the style?
- What's the setting or context?
- What mood do you want?

### 2. Write Your First Prompt

Use the formula from the Prompting for Architecture lesson:

> Building type + Style + Materials + Lighting + Camera + Mood

### 3. Generate 3-5 Variations

Try different approaches:

- Different times of day
- Different camera angles
- Different material choices
- Interior vs. exterior views

### 4. Select Your Favorite

Choose the image that best captures your vision and write a brief reflection:

- What does it capture correctly?
- What would you change?
- How does it inform your design thinking?
- What details surprised you — good or bad?

### 5. Optional: Compare Tools

Try the same concept in 2-3 different tools and compare results. Note the strengths and weaknesses of each.

## Reflection Questions

After completing the exercise, consider:

- Did the AI output match what you imagined? Where did it differ?
- Did seeing your concept visualized change any of your design preferences?
- Which tool felt most natural to work with?
- How might you use AI tools in your next design iteration?

## Closing Thoughts

AI is not a magic wand that eliminates the need for design thinking. The students who get the most value from these tools are those who understand the fundamentals of architecture — space, light, proportion, materiality, and human experience.

You've built that foundation in this course. Now these tools can help you bring your vision to life.

Welcome to the future of design.
