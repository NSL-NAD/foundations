# Exercise: Visualize Your Dream Home

This is the capstone exercise for the AI module. You will take everything you have learned — your design vision, your material preferences, your prompting skills — and use AI to generate a visual concept of your dream home. By the end of this exercise, you will have at least one image that captures your architectural vision in photorealistic detail.

**Time:** 30-45 minutes

**You will need:**

- Your Design Brief from Module 6, or your vision notes from the Kickoff module
- The AI prompt you wrote in the Prompting for Architecture lesson
- Access to one of the tools covered in this module (Nano Banana Pro is recommended — it is free and produces excellent architectural results)

## Step 1: Summarize Your Vision

Before you open any tool, write 2-3 sentences that capture the essence of your dream home. Answer these three questions:

- What is the architectural style?
- What is the setting or context — urban, suburban, rural, coastal?
- What mood or feeling do you want the space to create?

This summary is your north star for the exercise. Every prompt you write should trace back to this vision.

## Step 2: Write Your First Prompt

Use the formula from the Prompting for Architecture lesson to craft a detailed prompt:

> Building type + Style + Materials + Lighting + Camera angle + Mood + Technical specs

If you already wrote a prompt in that lesson, start with it. If not, build one now. Be specific about materials — use your Module 4 vocabulary. Be intentional about lighting and camera angle — these define the emotional quality of the image.

## Step 3: Generate 3-5 Variations

Use your chosen tool to generate multiple versions of your concept. With each variation, change one element:

- **Different times of day** — golden hour, twilight, overcast midday
- **Different camera angles** — eye-level, aerial, 3/4 perspective
- **Different material choices** — swap the exterior cladding, change the flooring
- **Interior vs. exterior views** — see the space from both outside and inside

Each variation teaches you something about your preferences. Pay attention to your gut reactions — which images make you pause? Which ones feel wrong? Those responses are design instincts at work.

## Step 4: Select Your Favorite and Reflect

Choose the image that best captures your vision and write a brief reflection:

- What does it capture correctly about your design intent?
- What would you change if you could refine it further?
- How does seeing your concept visualized inform your design thinking?
- What details surprised you — for better or worse?

> The gap between what you imagined and what you see is where the most valuable design learning happens. That gap reveals the assumptions, preferences, and priorities you did not know you had.

## Step 5 (Optional): Compare Tools

If you have time and curiosity, try the same concept in 2-3 different tools and compare the results. Each tool interprets prompts differently, and comparing outputs can reveal which aspects of your vision are clear and which need more specificity.

Note the strengths and weaknesses of each tool. Which one produced the most architecturally coherent result? Which one captured the mood best? Which was easiest to iterate with?

## Reflection

After completing the exercise, consider these broader questions:

- Did the AI output match what you imagined? Where did it differ, and what does that tell you about your vision?
- Did seeing your concept visualized change any of your design preferences? Sometimes seeing an idea realized makes you realize you want something different.
- Which tool felt most natural to work with, and why?
- How might you use AI tools in your next design iteration — whether that is refining this concept further or starting an entirely new direction?

## Closing Thoughts

AI is not a magic wand that eliminates the need for design thinking. The students who get the most value from these tools are those who understand the fundamentals — space, light, proportion, materiality, and human experience. You have built that foundation throughout this course.

Now these tools can help you bring your vision to life. Welcome to the future of design.
