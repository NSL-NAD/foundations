# Bonus Module AI Checklist

Use this checklist to confirm that you have absorbed the key concepts and completed the exercises from the AI for Architecture module. Review each item honestly — this is your self-assessment, not a test.

## Core Concepts

- [ ] **AI as a Design Partner.** Do you understand that AI amplifies your design thinking but cannot replace it? Can you articulate what AI needs from you — clear direction, architectural judgment, design principles, and practical constraints?

- [ ] **The Tool Landscape.** Can you name the major categories of AI tools for architecture — floor plan generators, image generators, interior visualization, 3D model generators, rendering tools, and video animation — and describe when each is most useful?

- [ ] **Floor Plans (Rayon).** Do you know how to use a browser-based CAD tool like Rayon to create and refine digital floor plans, and how to import hand-drawn sketches as a starting point?

- [ ] **Interior Visualization (Spacely AI).** Can you upload a room photo and generate styled interior visualizations to test material and style choices?

- [ ] **Concept Images (Nano Banana Pro).** Do you understand how to use Google's Nano Banana Pro to turn text descriptions and sketches into photorealistic concept images of architectural spaces?

- [ ] **Advanced Tools.** Are you aware of the intermediate and advanced tools — D5 Render for photorealistic rendering, Hunyuan 3D for AI-generated 3D models, and Kling 2.6 for video from still images — and when you might grow into using them?

## Prompting and Workflow

- [ ] **The Prompt Formula.** Can you construct an architectural prompt using the formula: Subject + Style + Materials + Lighting + Camera + Mood + Technical Specs?

- [ ] **Material Specificity.** Do you know the difference between vague material descriptions ("wood floor") and specific ones ("warm oak wide-plank flooring"), and why specificity matters for AI output quality?

- [ ] **Workflow Integration.** Can you describe where AI fits in the design process — from inspiration and concept through space planning, design development, and final visualization?

- [ ] **AI Limitations.** Do you understand what AI cannot yet do — verify structural integrity, ensure code compliance, produce construction documents, or guarantee accurate dimensions?

## Exercises

- [ ] **Prompt Writing.** Did you write at least one detailed architectural prompt using the formula, including building type, style, specific materials, lighting, camera angle, and mood?

- [ ] **Dream Home Visualization.** Did you generate concept images of your dream home using at least one AI tool, create 3-5 variations, and reflect on which captured your vision best?

- [ ] **Tool Exploration.** Have you tried at least one beginner-friendly AI tool (Rayon, Spacely AI, or Nano Banana Pro) and completed a basic workflow from start to output?

## Ready to Move On?

If you can check every box above, you have a solid understanding of how AI tools can support your architectural design process. You know the landscape, you can write effective prompts, and you understand both the capabilities and the limitations.

> The tools will keep evolving, but the principles will not. Your ability to think spatially, communicate a clear vision, and evaluate design quality — those are the foundations that make AI useful. And you have built those foundations throughout this course.

Most importantly, you now have the vocabulary and confidence to explore new AI tools as they emerge. Your lifetime access to this module means you will always have an updated reference as the technology changes.
