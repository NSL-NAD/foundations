## What It Is

Nano Banana Pro is Google's latest AI image model (part of Gemini 3 Pro). It excels at architectural visualization, blueprint-to-render conversion, and maintaining structural accuracy — making it one of the best free tools for turning your sketches into photorealistic concept images.

## Why We Recommend It

- Free access via Google AI Studio
- Best-in-class at understanding architectural geometry
- Can transform sketches into photorealistic renders
- Excellent at material and lighting accuracy
- Maintains consistency across multiple views

## Best For

Concept visualization, turning sketches into renders, and exploring design variations. This is the tool to reach for when you want to see what your dream home might actually look like.

## Key Prompting Tips for Architecture

- Be specific about camera angle (eye-level, bird's eye, etc.)
- Include lighting conditions (golden hour, overcast, etc.)
- Specify materials explicitly
- Describe the mood and atmosphere
- Include scale references (people, furniture)

### Example Prompt

> "Transform this floor plan into a photorealistic 3D visualization. Modern minimalist style, warm oak flooring, white walls, large windows with natural daylight streaming in. Eye-level perspective from living room looking toward kitchen. Include contemporary furniture and indoor plants for scale."
