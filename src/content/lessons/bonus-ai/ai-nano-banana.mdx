# Concept Images: Nano Banana Pro

Nano Banana Pro is Google's latest AI image model, part of the Gemini 3 Pro family. It excels at architectural visualization, blueprint-to-render conversion, and maintaining structural accuracy — making it one of the best free tools available for turning your design ideas into photorealistic concept images. If you want to see what your dream home might actually look like, this is the tool to start with.

## Why We Recommend It

**Free access:** Available through Google AI Studio at no cost. No subscriptions, no credit card required, no limits on experimentation.

**Architectural intelligence:** Nano Banana Pro understands architectural geometry better than most image generators. It can interpret floor plans, maintain structural logic, and produce images that look like real buildings rather than dreamlike hallucinations.

**Sketch-to-render capability:** Upload a hand-drawn sketch and ask the model to transform it into a photorealistic visualization. This is where your Module 3 drawings and Module 6 portfolio work can truly come to life.

**Material and lighting accuracy:** Specify materials like "honed Carrara marble" or "board-formed concrete" and the model renders them with impressive fidelity. Lighting conditions — golden hour, overcast, twilight — are handled with similar precision.

**Consistency across views:** Generate multiple angles of the same concept, and the model maintains visual consistency. This means you can create a coherent set of concept images rather than disconnected one-offs.

## Best For

Concept visualization, turning sketches into renders, and exploring design variations. This is the tool to reach for when you want to see what your dream home might actually look like — from the outside, from the inside, at different times of day, and with different material choices.

## Key Prompting Tips for Architecture

The quality of your output depends entirely on the quality of your input. Here are the principles that matter most:

**Be specific about camera angle.** "Eye-level perspective from the garden looking at the front entrance" gives a dramatically different result than just "house exterior."

**Include lighting conditions.** "Golden hour with warm side lighting" creates mood and atmosphere that make the image feel real.

**Specify materials explicitly.** "Warm oak wide-plank flooring" produces far better results than "wood floor." The more precise your material language, the more accurate the visualization.

**Describe the mood and atmosphere.** "Light and airy" versus "moody and dramatic" changes everything about how the space is rendered — from color temperature to shadow depth.

**Include scale references.** Adding people, furniture, or landscaping elements helps the model understand proportions and produces more believable results.

### Example Prompt

> "Transform this floor plan into a photorealistic 3D visualization. Modern minimalist style, warm oak flooring, white walls, large windows with natural daylight streaming in. Eye-level perspective from living room looking toward kitchen. Include contemporary furniture and indoor plants for scale."

## Getting Started

1. Visit aistudio.google.com and sign in with your Google account
2. Select the Nano Banana Pro model from the model picker
3. Upload your sketch or start with a text description of your vision
4. Use the prompting formula from the next lesson to structure your request
5. Iterate with follow-up prompts — refine materials, change angles, adjust lighting

> Start with your vision statement from the Kickoff module or your Design Brief from Module 6. Translate those words into a detailed prompt. Generate several variations and see which one best matches the feeling you described. The gap between what you imagined and what you see is where design learning happens.

Write a detailed prompt for your dream home exterior using the guidance above. Include the building style, at least two specific materials, a lighting condition, a camera angle, and a mood descriptor. Save this prompt in your notebook — you will use it in the exercise at the end of this module.
