# Floor Plans: Rayon

Rayon is a browser-based CAD tool designed specifically for interior designers and architects. It combines traditional drafting capabilities with AI assistance, making it one of the most approachable tools for creating and refining floor plans digitally. If you have been sketching floor plans by hand throughout this course, Rayon is the natural next step.

## Why We Recommend It

**Beginner-friendly interface:** Rayon is designed for people who are not professional drafters. The interface is intuitive, and you can start producing useful floor plans within your first session.

**Extensive block library:** Over 4,000 furniture and fixture blocks are included, so you can furnish and detail your plans without needing external resources.

**AI-powered layouts:** Describe what you want in plain language, and Rayon's AI can generate layout suggestions. This is especially useful for exploring room arrangements you might not have considered.

**Real-time collaboration:** Share your floor plans with others and work on them together, similar to how Google Docs works for text documents.

**Imports existing work:** Upload PDFs and images of hand-drawn plans or existing layouts, then trace over them or use them as a starting point.

**Free tier available:** You can get started without any financial commitment.

## Best For

Creating and refining floor plans, furniture layouts, and space planning. If you completed the spatial planning exercises in Module 3 — room programs, circulation paths, zoning diagrams — Rayon is where those hand-drawn ideas become polished digital floor plans.

## Getting Started

1. Visit rayon.design and create a free account
2. Start with a blank canvas or choose from the template library
3. Import your sketch as a background image if you have one
4. Use the block library to place walls, furniture, and fixtures
5. Try the AI panel — describe what you are looking for and see what it suggests

> Try importing your Module 3 floor plan sketch as a background image, then trace over it in Rayon. This bridges the gap between your hand-drawn work and a polished digital layout you could include in your Design Brief.

If you created floor plan sketches in Module 3, try importing one into Rayon. Spend 15-20 minutes tracing the basic walls and placing furniture. Note what feels different about working digitally versus by hand — what is easier, and what do you miss about the hand-drawn approach?
