# Interior Visualization: Spacely AI

Spacely AI is an AI-powered platform that transforms sketches, photos, or floor plans into photorealistic interior visualizations. Upload an image of a room, select a design style, and see it transformed in seconds. It is one of the fastest ways to test how different styles, materials, and color palettes feel in a real space.

## Why We Recommend It

**Instant style exploration:** Upload a photo of any room and see it transformed into Scandinavian, Modern, Traditional, Mediterranean, and dozens of other styles — all within seconds. This is the fastest way to test your instincts from Module 4.

**Works with empty rooms:** Spacely can stage completely empty rooms with furniture, materials, and accessories. This is called virtual staging, and it is incredibly useful for visualizing potential in a space that does not yet exist or is currently bare.

**Material and color swapping:** Beyond full style changes, you can target specific elements — swap countertop materials, change wall colors, test different flooring options. This level of control lets you iterate on details without starting over.

**Professional integrations:** For those who go deeper, Spacely integrates with Revit, SketchUp, and AutoCAD, bridging the gap between AI visualization and professional design software.

## Best For

Exploring design styles, showing before-and-after transformations, and testing material choices before committing. It is especially useful for understanding how different aesthetic directions feel in the same space — something that is very difficult to do with sketches alone.

## Getting Started

1. Visit spacely.ai and create an account
2. Upload a room photo, sketch, or floor plan
3. Select a style preset that matches your design direction
4. Generate your first visualization and review the results
5. Iterate — try different styles, materials, and angles on the same base image

> Use Spacely to experiment with the material and style preferences you identified in Module 4. Upload a photo of an existing room and transform it into each of your top style choices. Seeing your preferences applied to a real space is one of the most clarifying exercises you can do.

## Tips for This Course

The most valuable way to use Spacely in the context of this course is to bridge the gap between your written preferences and visual reality. You may have described your ideal kitchen as "warm, natural materials with clean lines" — but what does that actually look like? Spacely lets you answer that question in seconds rather than hours.

Try this exercise: take the same room photo and generate three different style versions. Compare them side by side. Which one feels most like home? That reaction — that gut feeling — is your design instinct at work, informed by everything you have learned about space, light, and materiality.

<BriefPath>
Find a photo of a room you like — it can be from your home, a listing, or an inspiration image. Upload it to Spacely and generate at least two different style variations. In your notebook, describe which version resonated most and what specific elements made it feel right. Connect your reaction to what you learned about materials in Module 4.
