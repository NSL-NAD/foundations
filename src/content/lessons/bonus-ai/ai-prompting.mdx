# Prompting for Architecture

The quality of your AI output depends largely on the quality of your input. This lesson teaches you how to communicate effectively with AI tools to get architectural results that are actually useful.

## The Architecture Prompt Formula

**Structure your prompts like this:**

> Subject or Building Type + Style + Materials + Lighting + Camera or View + Atmosphere or Mood + Technical Specs

### Example

> "A two-story contemporary beach house with floor-to-ceiling glazing and white stucco exterior. Natural oak decking wraps around the front facade. Shot at golden hour with warm side lighting. Eye-level perspective from the garden looking at the main entrance. Lush coastal landscaping with ornamental grasses. Photorealistic render, 16:9 aspect ratio."

## Key Terms to Use

### Architectural Styles

- Contemporary / Modern
- Mid-Century Modern
- Scandinavian Minimalist
- Mediterranean
- Craftsman
- Industrial
- Farmhouse
- Japanese / Zen

### Materials (Be Specific)

The more specific you are about materials, the better your results:

- "Warm oak wide-plank flooring" (not just "wood floor")
- "Honed Carrara marble countertops" (not just "marble")
- "Blackened steel window frames" (not just "black windows")
- "Board-formed concrete walls" (not just "concrete")

### Lighting

- Golden hour / Magic hour
- Overcast / Soft diffused light
- Direct harsh sunlight
- Twilight / Blue hour
- Interior with warm ambient lighting

### Camera Angles

- Eye-level perspective
- Bird's eye / Aerial view
- Worm's eye (looking up)
- Front elevation view
- 3/4 perspective
- Interior looking out

### Atmosphere

- Warm and inviting
- Clean and minimal
- Moody and dramatic
- Light and airy
- Cozy and intimate

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Too vague:** "A nice modern house"
**Better:** "A single-story modern residence with flat roof, floor-to-ceiling glazing, and desert landscaping"

**Contradictory:** "Cozy minimalist mansion"
**Better:** Choose one direction and commit

**Ignoring context:** Describing the building without the environment
**Better:** Include site, landscaping, sky, and time of day

**Forgetting scale:** No people, furniture, or references
**Better:** "Include two people on the front porch for scale"

## Practice Exercise

Take your Design Brief or vision statement from earlier in the course and rewrite it as an AI prompt using the formula above. Be as specific as possible about style, materials, lighting, and mood.
