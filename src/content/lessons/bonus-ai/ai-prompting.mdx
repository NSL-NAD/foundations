# Prompting for Architecture

The quality of your AI output depends almost entirely on the quality of your input. A vague prompt produces a vague image. A precise, architecturally informed prompt produces something you can actually use. This lesson teaches you the language of AI prompting — specifically tuned for architectural visualization — so you can communicate your design vision clearly and get results that matter.

## The Architecture Prompt Formula

Every effective architectural prompt follows a structure. You do not need to include every element every time, but this formula gives you a reliable framework:

> Subject or Building Type + Style + Materials + Lighting + Camera or View + Atmosphere or Mood + Technical Specs

The more of these elements you include, the more control you have over the output. Let us break each one down.

## Building the Prompt

### Subject and Building Type

Start with what you are visualizing. Be specific about the building type, scale, and key architectural features.

**Too vague:** "A nice modern house"

**Better:** "A single-story modern residence with a flat roof, floor-to-ceiling glazing on the south facade, and an integrated carport"

### Architectural Style

Name the style explicitly. AI models have been trained on vast image datasets, and specific style names activate visual patterns that produce coherent results.

- Contemporary / Modern
- Mid-Century Modern
- Scandinavian Minimalist
- Mediterranean
- Craftsman
- Industrial
- Farmhouse
- Japanese / Zen

### Materials — Be Specific

This is where your Module 4 knowledge pays off. The more precise your material language, the more accurate the visualization.

**"Warm oak wide-plank flooring"** instead of "wood floor"

**"Honed Carrara marble countertops"** instead of "marble"

**"Blackened steel window frames"** instead of "black windows"

**"Board-formed concrete walls"** instead of "concrete"

**"Natural cedar cladding with silver-grey patina"** instead of "wood siding"

The specificity tells the AI exactly what texture, color, and finish to render. Generic terms produce generic results.

### Lighting

Lighting defines mood more than almost any other element. Be explicit about the conditions.

- **Golden hour / Magic hour** — warm, directional, long shadows
- **Overcast / Soft diffused** — even, gentle, no harsh shadows
- **Direct harsh sunlight** — high contrast, strong shadows
- **Twilight / Blue hour** — cool ambient light, interior glow
- **Interior with warm ambient lighting** — cozy, inviting atmosphere

### Camera Angle

The camera angle determines what the viewer experiences. Each angle tells a different story about the space.

- **Eye-level perspective** — how a person would see it standing in the space
- **Bird's eye / Aerial view** — site context, relationship to landscape
- **Worm's eye (looking up)** — emphasizes verticality and drama
- **Front elevation view** — clean, architectural drawing style
- **3/4 perspective** — the classic architectural rendering angle
- **Interior looking out** — frames the view and connects inside to outside

### Atmosphere and Mood

This is the emotional layer. It guides the AI's decisions about color temperature, saturation, and overall feeling.

- Warm and inviting
- Clean and minimal
- Moody and dramatic
- Light and airy
- Cozy and intimate

## Putting It All Together

Here is a complete prompt using the formula:

> "A two-story contemporary beach house with floor-to-ceiling glazing and white stucco exterior. Natural oak decking wraps around the front facade. Shot at golden hour with warm side lighting. Eye-level perspective from the garden looking at the main entrance. Lush coastal landscaping with ornamental grasses. Photorealistic render, 16:9 aspect ratio."

Notice how every element of the formula is present: building type, style, materials, lighting, camera angle, atmosphere, and a technical specification. This level of detail gives the AI everything it needs to produce a coherent, useful result.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Too vague:** Prompts like "a nice modern house" give the AI no direction. You will get a generic result that does not reflect your vision.

**Contradictory directions:** "Cozy minimalist mansion" sends conflicting signals. Choose one direction and commit to it. You can always generate variations afterward.

**Ignoring context:** Describing the building without its environment produces a floating object. Include the site, landscaping, sky conditions, and time of day to ground the image in reality.

**Forgetting scale:** Without people, furniture, or other scale references, the AI has no way to communicate the size of the space. Add "two people on the front porch" or "a dining table for six" to anchor proportions.

**Over-prompting:** Trying to describe every detail in a single prompt can confuse the model. Start with the big moves — form, style, mood — and refine with follow-up prompts.

> Think of prompting as having a conversation with a very literal assistant. It will do exactly what you say, but it cannot read between the lines. The clearer and more specific your language, the closer the output will be to what you imagined.

<BriefPath>
Take your Design Brief or vision statement from earlier in the course and rewrite it as an AI prompt using the formula above. Include at least: building type, style, two specific materials, lighting condition, camera angle, and mood. Save this prompt — you will use it in the final exercise of this module.
