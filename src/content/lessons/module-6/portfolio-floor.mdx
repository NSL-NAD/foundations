# Step 3: Design the Flow

The floor plan is the heart of your portfolio. It reveals how spaces connect, how people move through the building, and how daily life unfolds within the walls you have designed. This is where all of your thinking about spatial organization, circulation, and function comes together on paper.

## What a Floor Plan Shows

A scaled floor plan is a horizontal cut through the building, typically taken about four feet above the floor. It shows:

- **Walls, doors, and windows** -- the boundaries and openings that define each room.
- **Room relationships** -- how spaces connect to one another, which rooms are adjacent, and where transitions occur.
- **Circulation paths** -- the routes people take to move through the building, from the front door to the kitchen to the bedroom.
- **Furniture placement** -- beds, tables, sofas, and counters drawn to scale to demonstrate that each room is appropriately sized and functional.
- **Wall openings** -- where natural light enters, where views are framed, and how indoor spaces connect to the outdoors.

## Drawing Your Floor Plan

If you have been sketching floor plans throughout the course, this is your chance to refine and finalize your best version. If you are starting fresh, follow these steps:

1. **Begin with zones.** Divide your floor plan into public zones (living, dining, kitchen, entry) and private zones (bedrooms, bathrooms, study). Place public zones where they have the best access to daylight, views, and outdoor spaces. Tuck private zones into quieter, more sheltered areas.

2. **Establish circulation.** Draw the main path from the front door into the building and through the primary living spaces. Then add secondary paths to bedrooms, bathrooms, and utility areas. Good circulation feels intuitive -- a visitor should be able to navigate the home without a map.

3. **Size the rooms.** Use your scale to make sure rooms are realistically proportioned. A dining table for six needs about 12 by 14 feet of space. A bedroom with a queen bed needs at least 10 by 12 feet. Hallways should be at least 3 feet wide, ideally 3.5 to 4 feet.

4. **Place furniture.** Drawing furniture to scale is one of the best ways to test whether your rooms actually work. It also helps the viewer immediately understand the purpose and capacity of each space.

5. **Add windows and doors.** Mark every opening. Remember your solar orientation work from Module 5 -- south-facing windows for daylight, smaller or shaded openings on the west, and cross ventilation paths where possible.

## Reference Your Earlier Work

This floor plan should build on concepts you explored in previous modules:

- **Module 2** introduced spatial relationships, zoning, and how rooms connect to create functional layouts.
- **Module 3** taught you the drawing conventions for floor plans -- line weights, symbols, and scale.
- **Module 5** showed you how sun, wind, and environmental forces influence window placement and room orientation.

Pull your earlier sketches out and use them as a starting point. Architecture is a process of refinement, not reinvention.

## Consider These Questions

As you work, keep asking yourself:

- Does the plan feel natural to move through, or are there dead ends and awkward turns?
- Does each room have enough natural light?
- Are noisy spaces (kitchen, living room) separated from quiet spaces (bedrooms, study)?
- Can you see a clear connection between indoors and outdoors?
- Does the plan support the daily life you described in your Vision Statement?

Your floor plan is the drawing that people will study the longest. Give it the time and attention it deserves.
