# Brief Builder: Final Compilation

This is the moment where all of your work comes together. Whether you have been following the Drawer Path, the Brief Builder Path, or a mix of both, this lesson guides you through organizing your project into a complete, polished portfolio.

## Overview

Throughout this course, you have created individual pieces — a vision statement, site plan, floor plan, elevations, materials board, and environmental diagram. Now it is time to compile them into a cohesive presentation that tells the story of your dream home.

## Step-by-Step Compilation

### 1. Gather Your Work

Collect all of the drawings, sketches, boards, and written documents you have created across Modules 1 through 6. Lay them out so you can see everything at once.

### 2. Organize in Sequence

Arrange your materials in this order for a logical narrative flow:

1. **Vision Statement** — What your dream home means to you
2. **Site Plan** — Where it sits and how it connects to its environment
3. **Floor Plan(s)** — How the interior spaces are organized and flow
4. **Elevations** — What the building looks like from the outside
5. **Section** (if completed) — How vertical spaces relate to each other
6. **Environmental Diagram** — How the design responds to sun, wind, and climate
7. **Material and Systems Board** — The palette of materials and technologies you selected
8. **Reflection Page** — Your personal reflection on the design journey

### 3. Add a Section View (Optional but Recommended)

If you have not yet created a section drawing, now is a great time. A section is a vertical cut through your building showing:

- Room heights and ceiling shapes
- Floor and roof thickness
- Relationships between different levels
- How light enters from above or the side

Even a simple section adds tremendous depth to your portfolio.

### 4. Write Your Reflection Page

This is one of the most important pieces. Answer these questions thoughtfully:

- **What part of the design process inspired you most?** Think about which modules or exercises felt most meaningful.
- **What challenges did you encounter and overcome?** Design is rarely straightforward — reflecting on obstacles shows growth.
- **How would you evolve your design with more learning?** This shows awareness that design is iterative and always evolving.

### 5. Polish and Present

Whether your portfolio is physical (paper in a folder or binder) or digital (scanned drawings in a document or presentation):

- Make sure every drawing is clearly labeled
- Add titles to each page or section
- Include your name and the project title
- Check that drawings are oriented consistently
- Add brief captions explaining key design decisions

<DrawerPath>Your portfolio is primarily visual — drawings, sketches, and boards with brief written annotations. Organize your work in the sequence listed above, ensuring each drawing is clean, labeled, and tells part of your design story. Add a short written reflection as the final page.</DrawerPath>

<BriefPath>Your portfolio is primarily written — spatial programs, narrative descriptions, and specifications. Organize your written documents in the sequence listed above, ensuring each section is clear, specific, and builds on the previous one. Consider adding simple supporting sketches or diagrams even if writing is your primary mode — they add clarity and variety.</BriefPath>

## Tips for a Strong Portfolio

- **Tell a story** — Your portfolio should flow from vision to detail, taking the viewer on a journey through your thinking
- **Quality over quantity** — A few well-crafted drawings are more powerful than many rough ones
- **Be honest** — Your portfolio reflects your current skills and your authentic vision. That authenticity is its greatest strength
- **Keep it** — This portfolio is a snapshot of where you are right now. Save it. You will be amazed at how far you grow from this starting point.

## What Comes Next

After completing your portfolio, explore the Bonus Modules for deeper dives into mood boards, working with professionals, and 3D modeling. Then visit the Resources section for recommended reading and next steps on your design journey.
