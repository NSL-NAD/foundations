# Step 5: Curate Materials and Systems

Materials give your design its physical identity. They determine how the building looks, how it feels to touch, how it sounds, how it weathers over time, and how it performs thermally. Your Material and Systems Board is a curated collection that brings these choices together in one place, showing the viewer not just what your building is made of but why.

## What to Include

Your board should cover both the visual character and the performance strategy of your design. Think of it as two layers working together:

### Materials and Finishes

Select and present the key materials for your building. At minimum, address:

- **Exterior walls.** What is the primary cladding? Wood siding, brick, stone, stucco, metal panels, or a combination? What color and texture?
- **Roofing.** Standing seam metal, asphalt shingles, clay tile, green roof, or another option?
- **Interior floors.** Hardwood, concrete, tile, cork, or carpet? Consider how each feels underfoot and how it interacts with light and sound.
- **Interior walls and ceilings.** Painted plaster, exposed wood, natural stone, or another finish? What atmosphere does each create?
- **Accent materials.** Countertops, cabinetry, hardware, fixtures. These smaller selections carry significant visual weight.

### Building Systems

Alongside your material palette, identify the systems that support your building's environmental performance:

- **Insulation type and strategy.** Where is it continuous? What R-values are you targeting?
- **Window specifications.** Double or triple glazing? What SHGC for south-facing versus west-facing glass?
- **Heating and cooling.** Heat pump, radiant floor, or another system?
- **Ventilation.** Natural cross ventilation, ERV, or a combination?
- **Renewable energy.** Solar panels, geothermal, or other strategies?
- **Water management.** Rain gardens, permeable paving, rainwater collection?

## How to Present It

You have several options for format:

1. **Physical board.** If you enjoy tactile work, mount material samples, color swatches, and images on a presentation board. Label each selection and note where it appears in the building.

2. **Digital board.** Create a digital layout using photos, color blocks, and text annotations. Organize materials by location (exterior, interior floors, interior walls) and systems by category.

3. **Annotated list.** If you prefer writing, create a detailed list with descriptions, colors, textures, and performance characteristics for each selection.

Whichever format you choose, make sure the viewer can quickly understand what the building is made of and how those choices support the vision you described in Step 1.

## Build on Module 4

Your material concept board from Module 4 is the starting point for this portfolio piece. Revisit it and consider:

- Have your preferences changed as you learned more about environmental performance?
- Are there new materials you want to introduce based on your energy systems and insulation research from Module 5?
- Does the palette still support the feeling described in your Vision Statement?

Expand the Module 4 board to include both interior and exterior selections, and add the systems layer to show that your material choices are both beautiful and functional.

## Why This Matters

<DrawerPath>Create a physical or digital **Materials Board** with actual samples, images, and color swatches arranged visually. Label each material with where it appears in your home and annotate with why you chose it.</DrawerPath>

<BriefPath>Write a **Materials Specification** in your notebook. For each material: describe its appearance and tactile quality, where it appears in the home, why you chose it (aesthetic, performance, or emotional reasons), and how it performs environmentally. Also document your building system choices — heating, cooling, insulation, and energy.</BriefPath>

A Material and Systems Board demonstrates that you think about buildings holistically. You are not just choosing finishes for appearance -- you are selecting materials that perform, that age gracefully, and that contribute to the comfort and sustainability of the home. This integration of aesthetics and performance is what distinguishes thoughtful design from decoration.
