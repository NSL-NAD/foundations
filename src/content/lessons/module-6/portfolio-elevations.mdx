# Step 4: Show the Face

If the floor plan reveals how your building works, the elevation reveals how it looks. An elevation drawing shows the exterior of the building as seen straight on from the outside -- no perspective, no distortion, just a flat, honest view of the face your home presents to the world.

## What Elevations Communicate

Elevations are where your material choices, window designs, and proportional decisions become visible. They communicate:

- **Materials.** What the walls are made of and how they are finished -- wood siding, brick, stucco, stone, metal panels. You can indicate materials through hatching, texture, or labeling.
- **Height relationships.** How tall the building is, how the roofline relates to the walls, and where each floor level sits relative to the ground.
- **Window and door design.** The size, shape, placement, and rhythm of openings. Windows are often the most expressive element of a facade.
- **Proportion and rhythm.** The visual balance between solid walls and openings, between heavy base and lighter upper stories, between repetition and variation.

## What to Draw

For your portfolio, create at minimum:

1. **A front elevation.** This is the primary face of your building -- the view a visitor sees as they approach. It should clearly express the character of your design.

2. **One side elevation.** This second view provides depth and helps the viewer understand the building as a three-dimensional form, not just a flat facade.

If you want to go further, you can draw all four elevations (front, back, and both sides), but two is sufficient for this project.

## How to Draw an Elevation

1. **Start from your floor plan.** Project the widths of walls, windows, and doors vertically from the plan. This ensures your elevation is accurate and consistent with your interior layout.

2. **Establish the ground line.** Draw a horizontal line representing the ground level. Everything builds up from here.

3. **Mark floor-to-floor heights.** Typical residential floor-to-floor height is about 9 to 10 feet. Mark these levels lightly across the drawing.

4. **Draw the roof.** Whether it is a pitched roof, a flat roof, or a shed roof, the roofline is one of the most important visual elements of the elevation. Make sure it relates well to the wall below.

5. **Add windows and doors.** Transfer their positions from your floor plan. Pay attention to alignment -- windows that line up vertically and horizontally create a sense of order and calm.

6. **Indicate materials.** Use light hatching, texture marks, or labels to show what each surface is made of. This is where your Module 4 material choices become real.

## Bring Module 4 Forward

Your material concept board from Module 4 is the reference for this drawing. As you indicate materials on your elevation, ask yourself:

- Do the exterior materials match the character described in your Vision Statement?
- Is there a clear hierarchy between primary surfaces and accent materials?
- Do the colors and textures work together as a composition?

## Consider the First Impression

The front elevation is the first thing people see. Think about the impression it makes:

- Does the entry feel welcoming and easy to find?
- Is the scale of the building appropriate for its setting -- does it feel at home on its site?
- Do the proportions of windows to walls create a pleasing rhythm?
- Does the roofline give the building a distinctive silhouette?

Take your time with this drawing. The elevation is where your building's personality becomes visible, and it is one of the most satisfying drawings in any architectural portfolio.
