# Step 6: Capture Environmental Response

Your Environmental Diagram is the drawing that connects your building to the natural forces acting on its site. It shows how your design responds to sunlight, wind, and temperature - not in theory, but in practice. This is where you prove that your dream home is designed to work with its environment.

## What to Diagram

Build on the Environmental Response Diagram you created in Module 5. If you completed that exercise thoroughly, this step is about refining, clarifying, and integrating it into your portfolio. If you need to start fresh or expand your earlier work, use the guidelines below.

### Sunlight Angles

Show how the sun interacts with your building at key moments:

- **Summer sun path.** Draw the high arc of the summer sun and indicate where shade is needed. Show how overhangs, trees, or other devices block direct sun from entering south and west-facing windows.
- **Winter sun path.** Draw the low arc of the winter sun and show how sunlight penetrates into the building through south-facing glazing. Indicate where thermal mass floors or walls absorb and store this heat.
- **Key moments.** If there are specific times of day that matter to your design - morning light in the kitchen, afternoon shade on the patio - call them out.

### Airflow Paths

Illustrate how air moves through your building:

- **Prevailing wind direction.** Show where the dominant breeze comes from and how it enters the building.
- **Cross ventilation.** Draw arrows through rooms with openings on opposite sides, showing the path air takes as it moves through.
- **Stack effect.** If your design includes vertical ventilation - warm air rising through a double-height space and exiting through high windows or a roof vent - show this with upward arrows.
- **Outdoor airflow.** Indicate how wind moves around the building and through outdoor spaces like courtyards or covered porches.

### Shading Strategies

Annotate the features that control sunlight exposure:

- **Roof overhangs** with their depth and the angle of sun they block.
- **Deciduous trees** that provide summer shade and allow winter sun through bare branches.
- **Evergreen plantings** used for wind screening or year-round privacy.
- **Architectural shading devices** like trellises, pergolas, louvers, or deep window reveals.

## How to Draw It

You can create this diagram as an overlay on your site plan, your floor plan, or as a standalone drawing. Use different line types or colors to distinguish between sun paths, wind arrows, and shading zones. Label everything clearly so that the diagram is self-explanatory.

Consider including a small section or elevation view alongside the plan to show vertical relationships - how overhangs relate to window heights, how the stack effect works through multiple levels, or how earth-sheltering affects the building's thermal performance.

## Connect to Your Earlier Work

This diagram should feel like a natural extension of the work you did in Module 5:

- Your sunlight and solar orientation study informs the sun path annotations.
- Your wind and ventilation research informs the airflow arrows.
- Your earth and insulation work informs any earth-sheltering or thermal mass callouts.
- Your energy systems selections appear as labeled components - solar panels, ERV locations, insulation zones.

## Why It Belongs in the Portfolio

The Environmental Diagram shows a reviewer that your design is more than a collection of pretty rooms. It demonstrates that you understand the forces acting on your building and that you have made intentional decisions to work with those forces. This kind of environmental thinking is what separates a well-designed home from one that merely looks good on paper.

<BriefPath>Write an **Environmental Performance Narrative** in your notebook. Describe your building's response to its environment in structured sections: sunlight angles and your shading strategy, cross-ventilation paths and how you achieve them, thermal mass and insulation approach, and any renewable energy systems. Reference specific design decisions from your earlier work.</BriefPath>
