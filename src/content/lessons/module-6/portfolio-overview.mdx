# Portfolio Overview

You have spent the entire course building skills, exploring ideas, and making design decisions about your dream home. You have studied how space is organized, how drawings communicate, how materials shape experience, and how buildings respond to their environment. Now it is time to bring everything together.

## The Capstone

This module is your capstone project. The goal is to synthesize everything you have learned into a complete, thoughtful design package -- a portfolio that showcases your design thinking, technical drawing skills, material selections, and environmental awareness. This is not about perfection. It is about demonstrating how far you have come and how clearly you can communicate your ideas.

## What You Will Create

Your final portfolio will contain eight components, each one drawing on work you have already begun in previous modules:

1. **Dream Home Vision Statement.** A short written description of the feeling, purpose, and inspiration behind your design. This anchors everything that follows.

2. **Site Plan.** A top-down drawing showing your building's placement on its site, including orientation, outdoor spaces, landscape features, and entry points.

3. **Floor Plan(s).** Scaled layouts showing room relationships, circulation flow, furniture placement, and wall openings. You may include one floor or multiple floors depending on your design.

4. **Elevations.** At minimum, a front elevation and one side elevation. These drawings reveal the visual personality of your building -- its materials, proportions, and the rhythm of its windows and doors.

5. **Section (Optional but Encouraged).** A vertical cut through the building showing interior heights, level changes, and the relationship between structure and space. If you completed a section drawing in Module 3, consider refining it for your portfolio.

6. **Environmental Diagram.** Your Environmental Response Diagram from Module 5, showing sunlight paths, airflow patterns, shading strategies, and any passive or active systems you have selected.

7. **Material and Systems Board.** A curated collection of materials, finishes, and building systems that shows the tactile and visual character of your design alongside the performance strategies that support it.

8. **Reflection Page.** A written reflection on your design journey -- what inspired you, what challenged you, and how you would evolve the project with more learning.

## How This Module Works

Each lesson in this module corresponds to one component of the portfolio. You will work through them in sequence, but feel free to move back and forth as your design evolves. Architecture is iterative. A decision you make while drawing elevations may cause you to revisit your floor plan, and that is perfectly normal.

You do not need to start from scratch on most of these deliverables. Throughout the course, you have been building sketches, diagrams, concept boards, and written reflections. This module is about refining that work, filling in any gaps, and organizing it into a cohesive presentation.

## What Makes a Strong Portfolio

A strong portfolio is not necessarily the one with the most polished drawings. It is the one that tells a clear story. A viewer should be able to look through your pages and understand:

- What kind of home you envisioned and why.
- How the spaces are organized and how they flow.
- What the building looks like from the outside and what materials give it character.
- How the design responds to sunlight, wind, and site conditions.
- What you learned through the process.

Clarity, consistency, and intention matter more than artistic skill. If your drawings are rough but your thinking is sharp, that will come through.

## Getting Started

Begin with your Vision Statement. Everything else in the portfolio should support and express that vision. Once you have your words on paper, move through the remaining lessons at your own pace, building each component and assembling the final package.

This is your project. Make it yours.
