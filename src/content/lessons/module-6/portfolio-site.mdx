# Step 2: Sketch the Big Picture

With your Vision Statement in hand, the next step is to zoom out and look at the big picture - literally. Your Site Plan is a top-down view of your building on its land, showing how the structure relates to the landscape, the sun, the wind, and the people who approach it.

## What Is a Site Plan?

A site plan shows your building's footprint placed within its site. It is drawn from above, as if you were looking straight down from a bird's-eye perspective. Unlike a floor plan, which focuses on interior rooms, a site plan focuses on the relationship between the building and everything around it.

A strong site plan includes:

- **Building footprint and orientation.** Where the structure sits on the lot and which direction it faces.
- **Outdoor spaces.** Patios, decks, courtyards, gardens, driveways, and walkways.
- **Landscape features.** Trees, plantings, slopes, water features, and natural elements you want to preserve or introduce.
- **Entry points.** How people arrive - the driveway, the front walk, the path from the street to the door.
- **North arrow.** Always indicate north so that sun orientation is clear.

## How to Approach It

Start with a blank sheet of paper and draw the boundary of your site. It does not need to be a real piece of land - you can invent one. But give it a shape, a size, and some character. Is it flat or sloped? Urban or rural? Wooded or open?

Next, place your building on the site. Think carefully about:

1. **Orientation.** Based on what you learned in Module 5, which direction should the long axis of your building face to capture winter sun and manage summer heat?

2. **Sun path.** Lightly sketch the sun's arc to confirm that your south-facing spaces will receive daylight and your west-facing areas are protected.

3. **Wind direction.** Mark the prevailing wind and consider how it interacts with your building's openings and outdoor spaces.

4. **Views.** Which direction offers the best views? Orient your primary living spaces to take advantage of them.

5. **Access and arrival.** Where does the driveway enter? Where do pedestrians approach? How does the sequence of arrival feel - is it direct or does it unfold gradually?

## Connect to Module 5

Your Environmental Response Diagram from Module 5 is a direct companion to this site plan. The environmental diagram focused on forces - sun, wind, shading. The site plan focuses on form - where things go and how they relate. Together, they tell the complete story of your building in its landscape.

If you completed the site mapping prompt in Module 5, use those observations as a starting point. The wind arrows, sun zones, shade patterns, and sound sources you documented should inform every decision you make here.

## Tips

- **Draw lightly at first.** Site plans evolve as you work. Start with loose placement and refine as the relationships become clearer.
- **Include a scale or reference.** Even a rough scale bar helps the viewer understand the size of the site and the building.
- **Show context.** If there are neighboring buildings, roads, or natural features nearby, include them at the edges of your drawing. They help establish the setting.
- **Think about layers.** Ground plane (paving, planting, grading), building footprint, and overhead canopy (trees, overhangs) each tell part of the story.

<BriefPath>Write a **Site Design Narrative** in your notebook. Describe where your building sits on its land: orientation relative to compass directions, outdoor spaces and how they connect to interiors, the approach sequence for visitors, landscape features, and how the building responds to sun, wind, and views. Include specific dimensions and compass directions where possible.</BriefPath>
