# Step 1: Define Your Vision

Every great project begins with a clear intention. Before you refine your drawings or finalize your materials, you need to articulate what your dream home is really about. What does it feel like? What values does it express? What kind of life does it support? Your Vision Statement answers these questions in your own words.

## What Is a Vision Statement?

A Vision Statement is a short written summary - one paragraph - that describes the feeling, purpose, and inspiration behind your dream home. It is not a technical description of rooms and square footage. It is a declaration of intent that captures the spirit of your design.

Think of it as the compass for your entire portfolio. Every drawing, material choice, and environmental strategy should trace back to the ideas expressed in this statement.

## How to Write It

Start by revisiting the work you did in the kickoff exercise and the design philosophy you developed earlier in the course. What themes emerged? What words kept coming up? What images or memories inspired your thinking?

Then write one paragraph that addresses these questions:

1. **What feeling do you want your home to create?** Calm and quiet? Open and energizing? Cozy and protective? Grounded and natural?

2. **What values drive the design?** Sustainability? Family togetherness? Connection to nature? Simplicity? Craftsmanship?

3. **What inspired you?** A place you visited? A childhood memory? A material you love? A way of living you admire?

4. **What kind of life will this home support?** Morning light in the kitchen? A workshop in the garage? A garden visible from every room? Space for gathering or space for solitude?

## Tips for a Strong Vision Statement

- **Be specific.** "A warm home" is vague. "A home where morning sunlight reaches the kitchen table and the sound of rain on the roof is part of daily life" is vivid and personal.
- **Be honest.** This is your design. Write what actually matters to you, not what you think sounds impressive.
- **Keep it concise.** One strong paragraph is better than a full page of general ideas. Aim for four to six sentences.
- **Use sensory language.** Describe what you see, hear, feel, and experience in the space. This grounds your vision in physical reality rather than abstraction.

## Example Structure

You do not need to follow this structure exactly, but it may help you get started:

> Begin with the feeling or atmosphere you want to create. Then name the values or priorities that guide your choices. Mention a source of inspiration - a place, a memory, a material. End with a sentence about how you imagine daily life unfolding in the home.

## Make It Personal

<DrawerPath>Express your vision visually. Create a single page that combines a few sketched images with key words and phrases that capture the spirit of your dream home. Think of it as a visual manifesto — part mood board, part annotation, part sketch.</DrawerPath>

<BriefPath>Your Vision Statement is the most personal piece of your portfolio. There is no right or wrong answer. The only requirement is authenticity. Write something that genuinely represents what you care about and what you want your design to communicate. Once your Vision Statement is complete, you have the foundation for everything that follows. Keep it visible as you work through the remaining portfolio steps. Let it guide your decisions.</BriefPath>
