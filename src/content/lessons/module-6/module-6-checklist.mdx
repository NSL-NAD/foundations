# Module 6 Checklist

Congratulations — you have reached the final checklist of the core course. This module brought together everything you learned into a complete dream home portfolio. Let's make sure all the pieces are in place.

## What You Created

- **Vision Statement** — A written summary of your dream home's feelings, purpose, and inspiration
- **Site Plan** — Building placement, orientation, landscape features, and environmental context
- **Floor Plan(s)** — Room layouts, circulation flow, furniture placement, and wall openings
- **Elevations** — Front and side views showing materials, proportions, and window/door design
- **Materials Board** — Curated material selections with notes on systems and sustainability
- **Environmental Diagram** — Sun paths, airflow patterns, shading elements, and passive strategies
- **Reflection Page** — Your personal reflection on the design journey

## Self-Check

Before you move on, ask yourself:

- Does my Vision Statement clearly express what I want my home to feel like?
- Does my Site Plan show building orientation, landscape, and entry points?
- Does my Floor Plan demonstrate thoughtful room relationships and circulation?
- Do my Elevations express the visual personality and material choices of my home?
- Does my Materials Board include at least 5 materials with reasons for each choice?
- Does my Environmental Diagram show how my design responds to sun, wind, and climate?
- Have I written a Reflection Page addressing what inspired me, what challenged me, and how I would evolve my design?
- Is my portfolio organized in a clear, sequential format?

## Key Takeaway

> There is no single right dream home — only one that feels authentic to who you are, where you want to live, and how you want to feel.

You have built a complete, thoughtful design package from the ground up. Whether you continue to the Bonus Lessons, start refining your design further, or take what you have learned into real-world conversations with architects and designers — you now have a strong foundation to build from.
