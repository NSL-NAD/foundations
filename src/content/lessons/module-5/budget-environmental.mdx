# Budget Checkpoint: Environmental Design

Sustainable features have varying cost-benefit profiles. Some pay for themselves quickly, others are long-term investments, and some are simply free if you plan for them from the start.

## High ROI (Usually Worth It)

- Extra insulation in attic (low cost, immediate energy savings)
- Air sealing (low cost, high impact on comfort and efficiency)
- Energy-efficient windows in extreme climates
- Proper solar orientation (free if planned early)
- Ceiling fans (low cost, reduce cooling loads)

## Medium ROI (Evaluate Carefully)

- Triple-pane windows (diminishing returns outside very cold climates)
- Heat pump water heaters (higher upfront, lower operating cost)
- ERV / HRV ventilation systems
- Rainwater harvesting

## Long ROI (Consider If Budget Allows)

- Geothermal HVAC (15-25 year payback typical)
- Green roofs (primarily aesthetic and environmental, slow financial return)
- Extensive solar thermal (often displaced by cheaper PV)

## Passive Design is (Almost) Free

The best sustainability features are decisions, not products:

- Orienting living spaces south (northern hemisphere)
- Right-sizing windows for each facade
- Designing overhangs for summer shade
- Placing the home to use prevailing breezes
- Minimizing west-facing glass (reduces cooling load)

These cost nothing if incorporated from the start — and can cost thousands to retrofit later. This is why environmental thinking belongs at the beginning of your design process, not as an add-on at the end.
