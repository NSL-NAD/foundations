# Module 5 Checklist

Use this checklist to confirm that you have absorbed the key concepts and completed the exercises from the Environmental Design module. Review each item honestly before moving on.

## Concepts

- [ ] **Passive Solar Design.** Do you understand how building orientation, window placement, thermal mass, and overhangs work together to capture winter sun and block summer sun?

- [ ] **Cross Ventilation and Stack Effect.** Can you explain how cross ventilation pulls breezes through a room and how the stack effect uses rising warm air to ventilate a building vertically?

- [ ] **Thermal Mass and Earth-Sheltering.** Do you know how dense materials like stone and concrete store and release heat, and how building into the earth provides natural insulation and temperature stability?

- [ ] **Energy Systems.** Have you considered which active energy systems -- solar panels, heat pumps, radiant floors, ERVs -- might complement the passive strategies in your dream home design?

- [ ] **Texture and Environmental Impact.** Can you describe how surface texture affects acoustics (absorption vs. reflection), light behavior (glare vs. diffusion), and thermal comfort (warm vs. cool underfoot)?

## Exercises

- [ ] **Window Sketch.** Did you sketch your dream home's windows with sun angles in mind, placing the largest glazing on the south face?

- [ ] **Earth-Sheltered Sketch.** Did you draw a cross-section of a home built into a slope, showing thermal mass, insulation, and south-facing glazing?

- [ ] **Site Mapping Prompt.** Did you map wind, sunlight, shade, and sound on a site you know?

- [ ] **Room Comparison.** Did you compare the acoustic, luminous, and thermal qualities of a stone room versus a wood-and-fabric room?

- [ ] **Environmental Response Diagram.** Did you create your Environmental Response Diagram showing sunlight paths, airflow patterns, shading elements, and (optionally) materials and systems?

## Ready to Move On?

If you can check every box above, you have a solid understanding of how buildings interact with their environment. You are ready to begin Module 6, where you will bring everything together into your final portfolio project.
