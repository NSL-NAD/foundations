# Sunlight & Solar Orientation

Sunlight is one of the most powerful tools available to you as a designer. It heats, illuminates, and shapes the mood of every room it touches. Understanding how the sun moves across the sky and how to work with that movement is fundamental to creating comfortable, energy-efficient buildings.

## Sun Path

The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, but its exact path changes with the seasons. In summer, the sun arcs high overhead, delivering intense, direct light for long hours. In winter, it tracks lower across the sky, casting longer shadows and entering buildings at steeper angles.

This daily and seasonal rhythm determines which walls receive the most heat, which rooms get the most daylight, and where shadows fall throughout the day. Every design decision about window placement, room orientation, and shading should account for this movement.

## Passive Solar Design

Passive solar design is the practice of capturing the sun's energy in winter and blocking it in summer, all through the shape and orientation of the building itself rather than through mechanical systems.

The key principles are straightforward:

1. **Orient the longest walls** to face south (in the northern hemisphere) to maximize winter sun exposure.
2. **Use thermal mass materials** like concrete, stone, or tile on south-facing floors and walls to absorb daytime heat and release it slowly after sunset.
3. **Design roof overhangs** that shade south-facing windows in summer (when the sun is high) but allow sunlight to enter in winter (when the sun is low).
4. **Minimize openings on the west face**, where harsh afternoon sun can cause overheating during warm months.

## Glazing Strategy

Your window design directly affects energy performance and comfort:

- **South-facing windows** are your best asset. They receive consistent, manageable sunlight throughout the day and are the easiest to shade with overhangs.
- **North-facing windows** provide soft, even light without direct sun, making them ideal for studios, offices, and spaces where glare is a concern.
- **East-facing windows** capture morning light, which is generally welcome and easy to manage.
- **West-facing windows** require careful attention. Afternoon sun is low, hot, and difficult to shade. Use smaller windows, deep reveals, or exterior shading on this face.

## Daylighting

Beyond heating and cooling, sunlight serves a second vital purpose: illuminating your interior spaces naturally. Good daylighting design allows natural light to penetrate deep into rooms, reducing the need for electric lighting during the day.

Strategies include using light shelves to bounce sunlight toward the ceiling, placing windows high on walls (clerestories) to push daylight further into the floor plan, and choosing interior finishes that reflect rather than absorb light.

## Exercise: Sketch Your Windows with the Sun in Mind

Take a moment to sketch your dream home in plan view. Mark north on your drawing. Now add windows, thinking carefully about orientation:

1. Place your largest windows on the south-facing wall.
2. Add moderate windows on the east for morning light.
3. Keep west-facing windows small or well-shaded.
4. Use north-facing windows where you want soft, consistent light.
5. Draw a simple sun arc over your plan showing summer (high) and winter (low) paths.

This exercise will help you see how solar orientation directly shapes your floor plan and your daily experience of the space.
