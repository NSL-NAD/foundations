# Energy Systems

Once you have oriented your building to the sun, planned for natural ventilation, and leveraged the thermal properties of the earth, the next step is to consider the active energy systems that will support your design. The goal is not to pile on technology but to select systems that complement the passive strategies you have already put in place.

**Good design reduces the need for energy, not just uses it efficiently.** This principle should guide every decision in this lesson.

## Solar Panels

Photovoltaic (PV) solar panels convert sunlight directly into electricity. They are one of the most accessible renewable energy technologies available for residential buildings. When you design with solar in mind, consider these factors:

- **Roof orientation and pitch.** South-facing roofs with a pitch between 15 and 40 degrees capture the most energy in the northern hemisphere.
- **Shading.** Even partial shade from trees or neighboring buildings can significantly reduce panel output. Plan your site to keep the solar zone clear.
- **Roof area.** A typical residential system requires 200 to 400 square feet of unobstructed roof space.
- **Integration with design.** Solar panels can be integrated into the roof form rather than mounted as an afterthought. Some systems replace conventional roofing materials entirely.

## Passive Solar Heating

You explored passive solar principles in the sunlight lesson, but it is worth reinforcing how these strategies function as an energy system in their own right. South-facing windows, thermal mass floors, and properly sized overhangs work together to collect, store, and distribute solar heat without any mechanical equipment.

In a well-designed passive solar home, the sun provides a substantial portion of the heating load during winter months. The building itself becomes the heating system -- walls and floors absorb energy during the day and release it slowly through the evening and night.

## High-Performance Insulation

Insulation is the quiet workhorse of energy-efficient design. High-performance insulation materials dramatically reduce heat transfer through walls, roofs, and floors, keeping conditioned air inside where it belongs.

Key insulation concepts to understand:

- **R-value** measures a material's resistance to heat flow. Higher R-values mean better insulation.
- **Continuous insulation** wraps the entire building envelope without gaps, eliminating thermal bridges where heat can escape.
- **Common high-performance materials** include rigid foam boards, spray foam, mineral wool, and structural insulated panels (SIPs).

The most important thing about insulation is consistency. A building with excellent insulation on the walls but poor insulation at the roof or foundation will still lose significant energy through those weak points.

## Efficient HVAC Systems

Even the best passive design will need some mechanical heating and cooling in most climates. The key is to choose systems that are efficient, appropriately sized, and well-matched to your building's needs.

- **Heat pumps** move heat rather than generating it, making them two to three times more efficient than conventional furnaces. Air-source heat pumps work well in moderate climates, while ground-source (geothermal) systems perform in virtually any climate.
- **Radiant floor heating** distributes warmth evenly through the floor slab, maintaining comfort at lower air temperatures and working well with thermal mass.
- **Energy recovery ventilators (ERVs)** bring fresh outdoor air into tightly sealed buildings while capturing heat (or coolness) from the exhaust air. They maintain air quality without sacrificing energy performance.

## Bringing It Together

The most successful energy strategies are layered. Start with the building's orientation and form. Add insulation and thermal mass. Then select mechanical systems that handle whatever the passive strategies cannot. Each layer reduces the demand on the next, resulting in a building that is comfortable, resilient, and economical to operate over its lifetime.
