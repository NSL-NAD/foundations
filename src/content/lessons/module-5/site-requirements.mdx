# Environmental Response Diagram

This is the Site Requirements Document exercise for Module 5. You have spent this module learning how sunlight, wind, earth, and energy systems shape the way buildings interact with their environment. Now it is time to bring all of that knowledge together into a single, comprehensive diagram for your dream home.

## What Is an Environmental Response Diagram?

An Environmental Response Diagram is a drawing that shows how your building design responds to the natural forces on its site. It combines sun paths, airflow patterns, shading strategies, and material choices into one visual summary. Think of it as the environmental layer of your design -- the drawing that proves your building is not just beautiful but smart.

## Your Task

<DrawerPath>Sketch an Environmental Response Diagram for your dream home. You can work over a copy of your site plan or floor plan, or create a new drawing from scratch. Include the following layers of information described below.</DrawerPath>

<BriefPath>Write an **Environmental Response Narrative** in your notebook. Organize it into sections: (1) **Sunlight Strategy** — how your building captures winter sun and manages summer heat, (2) **Airflow Plan** — prevailing wind direction and how you achieve cross-ventilation, (3) **Shading Features** — overhangs, trees, or devices you would use, (4) **Materials and Systems** — thermal mass, insulation approach, and any renewable energy or water management. For each, describe the specific design decisions and why they make sense for your site.</BriefPath>

Include the following layers of information:

### 1. Sunlight Paths

Draw the sun's path across your site for both summer and winter:

- Show the **summer sun arc** high overhead, noting where it rises and sets.
- Show the **winter sun arc** lower on the horizon, noting how it enters the building at a steeper angle.
- Indicate which faces of your building receive the most direct sun at each season.

### 2. Airflow Patterns

Sketch how air moves through and around your building:

- Mark the **prevailing wind direction** with arrows.
- Show **cross ventilation paths** through rooms with openings on opposite walls.
- If your design includes any vertical ventilation (stack effect), indicate the upward movement of warm air and where it exits.

### 3. Shading Elements

Annotate the features that control sunlight:

- **Roof overhangs** and their depth relative to south-facing windows.
- **Trees** on the site, noting whether they are deciduous (providing summer shade and winter sun) or evergreen (providing year-round screening).
- **Trellises, pergolas, or louvers** used for additional shading control.
- **Neighboring structures or landforms** that cast shadows onto your site.

### 4. Materials and Systems (Optional)

If you are ready to go deeper, add labels for the materials and systems you intend to use to manage light, heat, and air:

- **Thermal mass elements** -- concrete floors, stone walls -- and where they receive direct sunlight.
- **Insulation zones** -- where high-performance insulation wraps the building envelope.
- **Solar panels** -- if included, show their location and orientation.
- **Ventilation devices** -- operable windows, skylights, ERVs.
- **Stormwater management** -- rain gardens, permeable paving, swales.

## Tips for a Strong Diagram

- **Use color or line weight** to distinguish between different types of information (sun paths, wind arrows, shading zones).
- **Label everything clearly.** A viewer should be able to understand your environmental strategy without additional explanation.
- **Keep it simple but complete.** You do not need to draw every detail of the building. Focus on the environmental relationships.
- **Reference your earlier work.** Pull in ideas from your sunlight, wind, earth, and energy systems lessons.

## Why This Matters

This diagram is more than a class exercise. It is a document that professional architects create during the schematic design phase to communicate their environmental strategy to clients, engineers, and consultants. By completing it now, you are practicing a real-world skill that bridges design intent and environmental performance.

Your Environmental Response Diagram will also become a key component of your final portfolio in Module 6. Take the time to make it thorough and clear.
