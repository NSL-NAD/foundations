# Course Check-in

Congratulations on making it through the core course. You have explored architectural ideas, learned to draw and communicate design, selected materials and systems, responded to environment, and compiled a portfolio that represents your dream home. That is a tremendous amount of learning.

## Finalize Your Design Brief

At this stage, you are ready to finalize your Design Brief — a professional, compiled document that captures every decision you have made throughout this course.

You have two options:

1. **Fill out the Design Brief Template.** Download the fillable PDF template attached to the Final Compilation lesson in Module 6 and complete each section by hand. This is a great option if you prefer a tactile, pen-and-paper approach.

2. **Generate your Design Brief automatically.** If you have been using the Course Notebook to take notes and upload reference materials as you progressed through lessons, we can compile everything into a polished, personalized Design Brief for you. Choose your color palette, typography, and title — then let us do the rest.

**Pro Tip:** The more notes and uploads you have added to your Course Notebook throughout the course, the richer and more detailed your generated Design Brief will be. If you have not used the notebook yet, you can still go back and add notes to any lesson before generating.

## What Happens Next

The bonus lessons ahead cover additional topics to deepen your understanding and prepare you for the next stages of your design journey — from presentation tips and working with professionals to 3D modeling and AI tools.

Take your time with them. There is no rush. You have already built a strong foundation.
