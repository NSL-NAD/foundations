# Other 3D Tools

SketchUp is a great starting point, but it's not the only free option. In this lesson, you'll explore two additional tools -- **Floorplanner** and **HomeByMe** -- that offer different strengths depending on what you're trying to accomplish. Each takes a slightly different approach to helping you visualize your design in three dimensions.

## Floorplanner

**Best for:** Quick 2D and 3D floor plans with minimal learning curve.

Floorplanner is a browser-based tool designed specifically for creating floor plans. Its drag-and-drop interface makes it fast to lay out rooms, add furniture, and generate a 3D walkthrough -- often in under an hour.

### Getting Started

1. Go to **floorplanner.com** and create a free account
2. Start a new project and you'll see a 2D grid workspace
3. Draw rooms by clicking and dragging walls, or use the room tool to drop preset shapes

### Key Features

- **Wall drawing** -- Click to place wall endpoints. Rooms snap together cleanly, and dimensions appear automatically.
- **Furniture library** -- Drag and drop from a large catalog of furniture, appliances, fixtures, and decor items.
- **2D to 3D toggle** -- Switch between a flat floor plan view and a fully rendered 3D perspective with a single click.
- **Automatic measurements** -- Room dimensions update in real time as you adjust walls.

### Creating a Floor Plan

1. Draw your exterior walls first, matching the dimensions from your hand-drawn plan
2. Add interior walls to define rooms
3. Place doors and windows from the library -- they'll cut openings automatically
4. Drag in furniture to test room sizing and layout
5. Switch to 3D view to walk through your design

Floorplanner is particularly useful when you want to quickly test whether your room sizes work with real furniture. Placing a dining table and six chairs into your dining room instantly reveals whether the space is generous or tight.

## HomeByMe

**Best for:** Interior visualization and realistic room styling.

HomeByMe focuses on the interior experience. It excels at showing what a space will look and feel like when furnished, with realistic materials, lighting, and branded furniture from real manufacturers.

### Getting Started

1. Go to **homebyme.com** and create a free account
2. Start a new project by drawing your floor plan or importing an existing one
3. Build in 2D, then explore your design in 3D

### Key Features

- **Realistic rendering** -- HomeByMe generates high-quality images of your interior spaces with accurate lighting and shadows.
- **Brand-name furniture** -- Choose from real products by manufacturers like IKEA, making it easy to plan with items you can actually purchase.
- **Material application** -- Apply flooring, wall colors, and countertop materials to see how your palette looks in context.
- **Multiple viewpoints** -- Explore your design from bird's-eye, first-person, and custom camera angles.

### Creating an Interior Visualization

1. Draw your room boundaries or import a floor plan image as a tracing guide
2. Set wall heights and add doors and windows
3. Choose flooring and wall materials from the library
4. Furnish the space with items from the catalog
5. Generate a 3D rendering to see the finished result

HomeByMe is ideal for testing interior design decisions: Does this wood floor work with those cabinet colors? How does the living room feel with a sectional versus two armchairs? The visual realism helps answer questions that abstract drawings leave open.

## Comparing the Tools

| Feature | Floorplanner | HomeByMe |
|---|---|---|
| Best use | Quick floor plans | Interior visualization |
| Learning curve | Very low | Low |
| 3D quality | Good schematic views | Realistic rendering |
| Furniture library | Large, generic | Branded products |
| Floor plan drawing | Fast and intuitive | Functional |
| Free tier limits | 1 project | 3 projects |
| Platform | Browser | Browser |

## When to Use Each Tool

- **Use Floorplanner** when you want to rapidly test room layouts, experiment with different configurations, or create a clean 2D plan with instant 3D preview.
- **Use HomeByMe** when you want to explore how interior finishes, furniture, and materials come together in a realistic setting.
- **Use SketchUp** (covered in the previous lesson) when you want more control over building form, custom geometry, and exterior massing.

These tools complement each other. You might start with SketchUp for the overall building form, use Floorplanner to quickly test interior layouts, and turn to HomeByMe to visualize your material and furniture choices. There's no single right tool -- use whichever one helps you understand your design better.

## Getting the Most From Free Tools

All three platforms are free to start with. The free tiers have some limitations (project counts, export quality, feature access), but they're more than sufficient for the kind of design exploration you're doing in this course. Focus on learning the basics, testing your ideas, and building confidence with digital tools. If you find one that clicks, you can always upgrade later.
