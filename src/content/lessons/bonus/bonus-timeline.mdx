# What to Expect - Timeline

Designing and building a home is a journey measured in months, not weeks. Understanding the typical timeline helps you plan realistically, set expectations with your family, and stay informed at every stage. This lesson walks through each major phase of a residential project, from the earliest conversations to the day you move in.

## The Big Picture

A custom residential project typically takes **twelve to twenty-four months** from the first design meeting to move-in day. Smaller renovations can be shorter, and complex projects can run longer. The key is that design and construction both take time - and rushing either one leads to costly mistakes.

Here's what each phase looks like:

## Phase 1: Pre-Design (2 to 4 weeks)

This is the discovery phase. You meet with your architect, discuss your vision, tour the site, and define the scope of the project. Your design brief, mood board, and early sketches are invaluable here.

**What happens:**
- Initial client-architect meetings
- Site visit and analysis
- Review of zoning and building code requirements
- Budget discussion and goal-setting
- Programming (listing spaces, sizes, and priorities)

**Your role:** Share your vision clearly. Provide your brief and references. Ask questions about the process.

## Phase 2: Schematic Design (4 to 8 weeks)

The architect translates your program into initial design concepts. You'll see rough floor plans, site layouts, and massing studies. This is the most creative and exploratory phase.

**What happens:**
- Multiple concept options developed
- Floor plan layouts and spatial organization
- Basic exterior massing and form studies
- Review meetings to discuss options and provide feedback
- Selection of a preferred direction

**Your role:** Give honest feedback. Don't be afraid to say what's working and what isn't. This is the least expensive time to make changes.

## Phase 3: Design Development (4 to 8 weeks)

The chosen concept is developed in detail. The architect refines the plans, selects materials, coordinates with structural and mechanical engineers, and produces elevations and sections.

**What happens:**
- Detailed floor plans with dimensions
- Exterior and interior elevations
- Building sections showing vertical relationships
- Material selections and specifications
- Structural and mechanical engineering coordination
- Preliminary cost estimating

**Your role:** Make material and finish decisions. Review drawings carefully. Raise concerns early - changes become more expensive as the project progresses.

## Phase 4: Construction Documents (6 to 10 weeks)

This is the technical documentation phase. The architect produces the detailed drawings and specifications that contractors will use to build your home and that the building department will review for permits.

**What happens:**
- Complete architectural drawings (plans, elevations, sections, details)
- Structural engineering drawings
- Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) documentation
- Specifications for materials and construction methods
- Permit application submission

**Your role:** Review documents for accuracy. Confirm that all your requirements are captured. This is your last opportunity to make changes before construction begins.

## Phase 5: Bidding and Permitting (4 to 8 weeks)

Construction documents go out to contractors for pricing. Simultaneously, the building department reviews your plans for code compliance.

**What happens:**
- Distribution of documents to selected contractors
- Contractors visit the site and prepare bids
- Bid review and comparison
- Contractor selection and contract negotiation
- Building permit review and approval

**Your role:** Review bids with your architect. Ask questions about pricing differences. Don't automatically choose the lowest bid - consider experience, references, and communication quality.

## Phase 6: Construction (6 to 18 months)

The building phase. Your design becomes real. Construction timelines vary widely based on project size, complexity, weather, and material availability.

**What happens:**
- Site preparation and foundation work
- Framing and structural assembly
- Roofing, windows, and exterior enclosure
- Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing rough-in
- Insulation and interior finishes
- Cabinetry, fixtures, and final details
- Inspections at key milestones
- Final walkthrough and punch list

**Your role:** Attend regular site meetings. Review progress with your architect. Make timely decisions on any open items. Expect some surprises - every construction project encounters the unexpected.

## Phase 7: Move-In and Closeout (2 to 4 weeks)

The final stretch. The contractor addresses any remaining punch list items, final inspections are completed, and you receive the certificate of occupancy.

**What happens:**
- Punch list completion (minor fixes and adjustments)
- Final inspections and certificate of occupancy
- Handover of keys, warranties, and manuals
- Move-in and settling in

**Your role:** Walk through the home carefully. Document anything that needs attention. Keep all warranty information organized.

## Staying Involved

Throughout the entire process, your engagement matters. Ask questions, attend meetings, review drawings, and communicate openly with your team. The more informed and involved you are, the more likely the final result will match your vision.

Patience is part of the process. A well-designed, well-built home is worth the time it takes to do it right.
