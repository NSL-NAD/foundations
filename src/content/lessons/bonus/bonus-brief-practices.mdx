# Design Brief Best Practices

A design brief is a concise document that captures everything a designer or architect needs to know about your project before they begin. Think of it as a roadmap for your design - it communicates your vision, your requirements, and your priorities in a clear, organized format.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to prepare a strong design brief using the work you've already done throughout the course.

## What Is a Design Brief?

A design brief is not a set of blueprints. It's a written summary of your design intentions, practical requirements, and personal preferences. It answers the fundamental question: **What do you want this home to be?**

Professionals rely on design briefs to understand a client's goals before they start drawing. A well-written brief saves time, reduces miscommunication, and ensures that everyone involved is working toward the same vision.

Even if you never hire an architect, writing a design brief sharpens your own thinking. It forces you to prioritize, make decisions, and articulate what matters most.

## What to Include

A complete design brief covers several key areas:

### 1. Vision Statement

Start with the big picture. In two to three sentences, describe the overall feeling and character of the home you want. This is where your mood board and Day in the Life narrative come together in words.

> *Example: "A single-story home that feels open to the landscape, with natural materials, generous natural light, and a calm, grounded atmosphere. The design should support both social gatherings and quiet retreat."*

### 2. Spatial Requirements

List the rooms and spaces you need, along with any specific requirements:

- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Kitchen layout preferences (open, galley, island)
- Living and dining arrangements
- Home office, studio, or workshop needs
- Storage requirements
- Outdoor living spaces (porch, patio, garden)
- Garage or parking needs

Be specific where it matters, but leave room for the designer to explore solutions you haven't considered.

### 3. Lifestyle Needs

Describe how you live day to day. This context helps a designer make informed decisions:

- How many people live in the home?
- Do you work from home?
- Do you entertain often?
- Are there accessibility considerations?
- Do you have pets?
- What hobbies or activities need dedicated space?

### 4. Material Preferences

Reference the material palette you developed during the course:

- Preferred materials (wood species, stone types, metals)
- Materials you want to avoid
- Interior finish preferences (floors, walls, ceilings)
- Exterior cladding preferences

### 5. Environmental and Site Considerations

Summarize the key findings from your site analysis and environmental design work:

- Site orientation and solar access
- Climate considerations
- Passive design strategies you want to incorporate
- Views to preserve or screen
- Landscape and outdoor priorities

### 6. Budget Considerations

You don't need an exact number, but providing a realistic range helps set expectations:

- Overall project budget range
- Areas where you're willing to invest more
- Areas where you'd like to economize
- Phasing preferences if budget is tight (build in stages)

### 7. Timeline

- When do you hope to begin design?
- When do you need to move in?
- Are there external deadlines (school year, lease end, etc.)?

## Tips for Writing a Strong Brief

1. **Be clear, not clever** - Use plain language. Avoid jargon unless you're confident in the terminology. Say what you mean directly.

2. **Prioritize** - Not everything can be equally important. Identify your top three to five non-negotiable requirements and flag them clearly.

3. **Include visual references** - Attach your mood board or reference images. A picture communicates what paragraphs of description cannot.

4. **Stay open** - State your preferences, but signal where you're flexible. Phrases like "ideally" or "we're open to alternatives" give a designer room to bring their expertise.

5. **Keep it concise** - A design brief should be two to four pages. If it's longer, you're probably including too much detail. Save the specifics for conversations.

6. **Review it with your household** - Everyone who lives in the home should read and agree on the brief. Conflicting priorities discovered mid-design are costly.

## The Design Brief Template

<DrawerPath>Even if you primarily sketch, a written design brief sharpens your thinking and makes your portfolio more complete. Use the prompts and structure from this lesson to create a written brief alongside your drawings — it will help you communicate your vision to professionals.</DrawerPath>

The printable Design Brief Template included with this course provides a structured format to organize all of this information. Use it as a starting point, adapt it to your project, and bring it with you to any meetings with design professionals.

Your brief is a living document. Update it as your ideas evolve, and don't hesitate to revise it based on feedback or new discoveries. The clearer your brief, the better your design conversation will be.
