# SketchUp Quick Start

SketchUp Free is a browser-based 3D modeling tool that's approachable for beginners and powerful enough to create meaningful architectural models. In this lesson, you'll learn the basics: how to access the tool, navigate the workspace, draw shapes, and build simple room layouts from your hand-drawn floor plans.

## Getting Started

SketchUp Free runs entirely in your web browser -- no downloads required.

1. Go to **app.sketchup.com**
2. Create a free Trimble account (or sign in with Google)
3. Start a new project and you'll see a 3D workspace with a simple human figure for scale reference

You're ready to model.

## Basic Navigation

Navigating in 3D space takes a little practice. These three controls are essential:

- **Orbit** -- Hold the middle mouse button (or scroll wheel) and drag to rotate your view around the model. On a trackpad, use two-finger drag while holding the Option key (Mac) or middle-click equivalent.
- **Pan** -- Hold Shift and the middle mouse button to slide your view left, right, up, or down without rotating.
- **Zoom** -- Scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Scroll toward an area of interest to zoom into it.

Spend a few minutes just orbiting, panning, and zooming until moving through 3D space feels natural. This is the single most important skill for comfortable modeling.

## Drawing Basic Shapes

SketchUp uses a simple draw-and-push workflow:

### Lines and Rectangles

1. Select the **Rectangle** tool from the toolbar (or press R)
2. Click once to set a starting corner
3. Move your mouse to define the opposite corner
4. Click again to complete the rectangle
5. Type exact dimensions in the Measurements box at the bottom right (e.g., type `12',10'` for a 12-foot by 10-foot rectangle, then press Enter)

### Extruding to 3D

This is where flat shapes become three-dimensional:

1. Select the **Push/Pull** tool (or press P)
2. Click on any flat surface
3. Move your mouse upward to extrude it into a solid volume
4. Type a height value (e.g., `9'` for nine-foot walls) and press Enter

You've just created your first 3D room.

### Drawing Lines

The **Line** tool (press L) lets you draw edges on surfaces. Use it to divide a rectangle into smaller sections, which can then be pushed and pulled independently. This is how you create wall openings, steps, and other features.

## Creating Simple Room Layouts

Here's a step-by-step approach to translating your hand-drawn floor plan into a basic SketchUp model:

1. **Draw the outer boundary** -- Use the Rectangle tool to create the overall footprint of your floor plan. Enter the exact dimensions.
2. **Add interior walls** -- Use the Line tool to draw wall lines on the floor surface. Each line should match the position of walls in your floor plan.
3. **Select and push walls** -- Use Push/Pull to extrude each wall section to your desired wall height (typically 8 to 10 feet).
4. **Create openings** -- Draw rectangles on wall surfaces where doors and windows should go. Push/Pull those rectangles through the wall to cut openings.
5. **Add a ceiling or roof** -- Draw a rectangle across the top of your walls and push it up slightly for a flat roof, or use the Line tool to create a pitched roof shape.

Don't worry about perfection. Your first model will be rough, and that's fine. The goal is spatial understanding, not photorealistic rendering.

## Helpful Tips for Beginners

- **Use the Measurements box** -- Always type exact dimensions after placing a shape. This keeps your model accurate and to scale.
- **Watch for inference points** -- SketchUp highlights midpoints, endpoints, and axis alignments in color. These snapping guides help you draw accurately.
- **Group your geometry** -- Select related faces and edges, right-click, and choose "Make Group." This prevents surfaces from sticking together and causing unintended distortions.
- **Save frequently** -- SketchUp Free saves to the cloud, but it's good practice to save manually after each major step.
- **Use Orbit constantly** -- Rotate your view often to check your model from different angles. A wall that looks correct from one side might be misaligned when viewed from another.

## Translating Your Floor Plan

Lay your hand-drawn floor plan next to your screen as reference. Start with the largest, simplest room and work outward. Don't try to model the entire house at once -- build room by room, checking proportions as you go.

Once your basic volumes are in place, step back and orbit through your model. Walk through it mentally. Does the kitchen feel open enough? Is the hallway too narrow? Can you see from the living room to the garden? These are the insights that make 3D modeling worth the effort.
