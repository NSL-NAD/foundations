# Architecture Terms Glossary

This glossary collects the key terms you've encountered throughout the course and adds several more that you'll come across as you continue exploring architecture. Use it as a quick reference guide whenever you need a definition.

## Drawing and Representation Terms

- **Floor Plan** -- A horizontal cut through a building, typically at about four feet above the floor, showing walls, doors, windows, and room layouts from above.
- **Elevation** -- A flat, straight-on drawing of one face of a building, showing its height, proportions, and exterior features without perspective distortion.
- **Section** -- A vertical cut through a building that reveals interior relationships, ceiling heights, floor levels, and how spaces connect from top to bottom.
- **Site Plan** -- A drawing that shows a building's position on its lot, including property boundaries, setbacks, driveways, landscaping, and orientation to north.
- **Detail Drawing** -- A close-up drawing of a specific construction assembly, such as how a wall meets a roof or how a window is framed.
- **Scale** -- The ratio between a drawing and the real building. A scale of 1/4" = 1'-0" means every quarter inch on paper represents one foot in reality.

## Design Terms

- **Proportion** -- The relationship between the dimensions of an element or between elements. Good proportion creates visual harmony.
- **Scale (Design)** -- How the size of a building or space relates to the human body. A room with a nine-foot ceiling feels different from one with a fourteen-foot ceiling.
- **Massing** -- The overall three-dimensional form and volume of a building. Massing describes the shape before details are added.
- **Articulation** -- The way surfaces, edges, and volumes are broken up or expressed. A highly articulated facade has depth, shadow lines, and varied materials.
- **Fenestration** -- The arrangement, sizing, and design of windows and doors in a building's exterior.
- **Threshold** -- The transitional zone between two spaces, such as the entry between outdoors and indoors. Thresholds shape how you experience moving through a building.
- **Circulation** -- The paths people take through a building. Hallways, stairs, and corridors are circulation spaces.
- **Axis** -- An imaginary line that organizes a plan or elevation. Axial layouts create a sense of order and direction.
- **Symmetry** -- A balanced arrangement where one side mirrors the other. Asymmetry, by contrast, creates dynamic, informal compositions.

## Structural Terms

- **Beam** -- A horizontal structural element that spans between supports and carries loads above it, such as floors or roofs.
- **Column** -- A vertical structural element that transfers loads from beams or slabs down to the foundation.
- **Load-Bearing Wall** -- A wall that carries structural weight from above. Removing or modifying a load-bearing wall requires engineering.
- **Foundation** -- The base of a building that transfers its weight to the ground. Common types include slab-on-grade, crawl space, and full basement.
- **Span** -- The distance a beam or slab covers between supports. Longer spans require stronger or deeper structural members.
- **Header** -- A horizontal beam above a door or window opening that carries the load of the wall above.
- **Truss** -- A triangulated structural framework used to span large distances, commonly found in roofs.

## Material and Construction Terms

- **Thermal Mass** -- Dense materials like concrete, brick, or stone that absorb and slowly release heat, helping regulate indoor temperatures.
- **Glazing** -- Glass elements in a building, including windows, skylights, and glass doors. Double and triple glazing improve insulation.
- **Cladding** -- The outer layer of a building's exterior. Cladding materials include wood siding, metal panels, brick, stone, and fiber cement.
- **Envelope** -- The complete outer shell of a building, including walls, roof, windows, and foundation. The envelope separates interior from exterior.
- **R-Value** -- A measure of thermal resistance in insulation materials. Higher R-values mean better insulating performance.
- **Flashing** -- Thin material (usually metal) installed at joints and transitions to direct water away from vulnerable areas.
- **Substrate** -- The underlying surface or base material to which finishes are applied.

## Environmental and Sustainability Terms

- **Passive Design** -- Design strategies that use natural forces (sun, wind, thermal mass) to heat, cool, and light a building without mechanical systems.
- **Solar Orientation** -- Positioning a building to take advantage of the sun's path for heating, lighting, and energy generation.
- **Cross Ventilation** -- Natural airflow achieved by placing openings on opposite sides of a space, allowing wind to pass through.
- **Daylighting** -- The practice of bringing natural light deep into a building through careful window placement, skylights, and reflective surfaces.
- **Overhang** -- A horizontal projection above a window or wall that shades the interior from high summer sun while admitting lower winter sun.
- **Green Roof** -- A roof partially or fully covered with vegetation, providing insulation, stormwater management, and habitat.

## Process and Professional Terms

- **Schematic Design (SD)** -- The first design phase, where the architect explores overall concepts, massing, and basic floor plans.
- **Design Development (DD)** -- The second phase, where the design is refined with more detail, including materials, systems, and structural considerations.
- **Construction Documents (CD)** -- The detailed drawings and specifications used for bidding and building. These are the final technical documents.
- **Bidding and Negotiation** -- The phase where contractors review construction documents and submit cost proposals.
- **Construction Administration (CA)** -- The architect's role during construction, which includes site visits, answering questions, and reviewing the builder's work.
- **Permit** -- Official approval from a local authority to proceed with construction, based on compliance with building codes and zoning regulations.
- **Zoning** -- Local regulations that control what can be built on a property, including building height, setbacks, lot coverage, and use.
- **Setback** -- The required minimum distance between a building and a property line, road, or other boundary.
- **Code** -- Building codes are regulations that establish minimum standards for construction, safety, accessibility, and energy performance.

Keep this glossary handy as you continue your design journey. The more fluent you become in these terms, the more confidently you'll communicate with professionals and engage with architectural ideas.
