# Hiring Tips -- Working With Professionals

At some point, your dream home design will move from paper to reality. When it does, you'll likely work with architects, designers, and contractors. Knowing how to find the right people, communicate your vision, and navigate the professional process will make the entire experience smoother and more rewarding.

## Finding the Right Architect or Designer

Start by looking at completed work. Browse firm websites, visit local projects, and ask friends or neighbors who've built or renovated recently. Look for professionals whose style and values align with yours.

Here are practical ways to find candidates:

- **The American Institute of Architects (AIA)** has a directory searchable by location and specialization
- **Houzz** and **Architizer** showcase project portfolios with client reviews
- **Local home tours and open houses** let you see work in person and sometimes meet the designers
- **Word of mouth** remains one of the most reliable sources -- ask people who've been through the process

When evaluating a firm, look beyond aesthetics. Consider their communication style, how they handle budgets, and whether they have experience with projects similar to yours in scale and scope.

## Questions to Ask During Interviews

Meet with at least two or three firms before making a decision. Come prepared with questions:

1. What is your design process, and how long does each phase typically take?
2. Have you designed homes similar in size and style to what I'm envisioning?
3. How do you handle budget constraints and cost overruns?
4. Who will be my primary point of contact throughout the project?
5. How do you involve clients in the design process?
6. Can you provide references from recent residential projects?
7. What does your fee structure look like, and what is included?
8. How do you work with contractors during construction?

Listen not just to the answers, but to how they answer. You'll be working closely with this person for months or even years. Mutual respect and clear communication matter as much as talent.

## What to Expect From the Design Process

A typical residential project moves through several phases:

1. **Pre-design** -- Initial conversations, site visits, and programming (defining your needs). This is where your design brief shines.
2. **Schematic Design** -- The architect develops initial concepts, floor plans, and massing studies for your review.
3. **Design Development** -- The chosen concept is refined with detailed plans, elevations, sections, material selections, and engineering coordination.
4. **Construction Documents** -- Technical drawings and specifications are produced for permitting and construction.
5. **Bidding** -- Contractors review the documents and submit bids. The architect helps you evaluate proposals.
6. **Construction Administration** -- The architect monitors construction, answers builder questions, and reviews the work.

Expect the design phases alone to take three to six months for a typical custom home, depending on complexity. Construction adds another six to eighteen months.

## Communicating Your Vision

This is where your coursework pays off. Bring your materials to the first meeting:

- **Your design brief** -- A clear summary of your goals, needs, and preferences
- **Your mood board** -- Visual references that show the feeling and atmosphere you want
- **Your floor plan sketches** -- Even rough drawings demonstrate thoughtful spatial thinking
- **Your Day in the Life narrative** -- This helps the architect understand how you actually live

Professionals appreciate clients who've done this kind of homework. It accelerates the process and leads to better outcomes because the designer understands your vision from day one.

## Understanding Fees and Contracts

Architects typically charge in one of three ways:

- **Percentage of construction cost** -- Usually 8 to 15 percent, depending on project size and complexity
- **Fixed fee** -- A flat amount for defined scope of work
- **Hourly rate** -- Common for smaller projects or consulting engagements

Make sure the contract clearly states what's included and what triggers additional fees. Common items to clarify:

- Number of design revisions included
- Whether interior design or landscape design is part of the scope
- Who handles permitting and engineering coordination
- Construction administration responsibilities and site visit frequency
- Reimbursable expenses (printing, travel, consultants)

Read the contract carefully. Ask questions about anything unclear. A good architect will welcome your diligence.

## Working With Contractors

Once construction documents are complete, you'll select a contractor. Your architect can help with this process. Key considerations:

- Get at least three bids for comparison
- Check references, licenses, and insurance
- Visit a current job site if possible
- Clarify the payment schedule and change order process
- Understand the warranty on their work

## Building a Good Working Relationship

The best projects are built on trust, communication, and mutual respect. Stay engaged throughout the process, ask questions when you don't understand something, and provide timely feedback when decisions are needed. Your design professional is your partner in bringing your dream home to life -- treat the relationship accordingly.
