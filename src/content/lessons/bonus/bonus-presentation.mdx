# Presentation Tips

You've spent weeks developing your dream home design. Now it's time to share it. Whether you're showing your portfolio to a family member, a designer you'd like to hire, or simply reviewing it yourself, how you present your work matters. A well-organized presentation turns a collection of drawings into a compelling design story.

## Organizing Your Drawings

Sequence is everything. Arrange your portfolio in a logical order that guides the viewer from the big picture down to the details:

1. **Vision and inspiration** - Start with your mood board and design intent. Set the tone before showing technical work.
2. **Site context** - Show where the home sits. Include your site analysis, orientation diagram, and any relevant surroundings.
3. **Floor plan** - The heart of your design. Present it clean and well-labeled.
4. **Elevations** - Exterior views that show how the building meets the world. Include at least two sides.
5. **Sections** - Cut-through views that reveal interior relationships, ceiling heights, and how spaces connect vertically.
6. **Materials and details** - Your material palette, close-up details, and any finish selections.
7. **Environmental considerations** - Passive strategies, sun path diagrams, ventilation concepts, and sustainability decisions.
8. **Day in the Life narrative** - If you completed this exercise, include it as a closing piece. It brings your design to life in a way drawings alone cannot.

## Layout and Visual Clarity

A few simple principles will elevate the look of your portfolio:

- **Use consistent margins** - Keep drawings centered with breathing room around the edges. Crowded pages feel chaotic.
- **Align your drawings** - Line up edges, center titles, and keep spacing even. Alignment signals care and attention.
- **Label everything** - Room names, dimensions, material callouts, north arrows, and scale references should all be present. Don't assume your viewer knows what they're looking at.
- **Use a title block** - Include your name, the project title, the drawing type, and the date on each page. This adds a professional touch and keeps pages organized.
- **Keep it clean** - Remove stray marks, erase construction lines, and make sure text is legible. If you're working digitally, use consistent fonts and sizes.

## Know Your Audience

How you present depends on who you're presenting to:

- **Family or friends** - Focus on the story. Walk them through a day in the home. Emphasize the mood board and explain your design decisions in plain language.
- **A designer or architect** - Lead with the floor plan, site plan, and technical drawings. They'll want to see how you think about space, structure, and flow. Include your environmental strategy.
- **A contractor or builder** - Emphasize dimensions, materials, and practical details. Contractors appreciate clarity, specific callouts, and realistic choices.

Adjust your language and emphasis based on who's listening, but always keep the full set of drawings available for reference.

## Physical Portfolio

A printed portfolio has a tactile quality that digital files lack:

- Use heavy-weight paper or card stock for durability
- Consider a simple binding - spiral bound, a portfolio binder, or even a clean folder
- Print at a consistent size so drawings feel unified
- Include material samples or swatches in a pocket if you have them
- A physical portfolio makes a strong impression when meeting with professionals

## Digital Portfolio

A digital version is practical, shareable, and easy to update:

- Export your work as a single PDF with pages in the correct sequence
- Keep file sizes reasonable - compress images if needed
- Use consistent page orientation (landscape works well for architectural drawings)
- Include a simple cover page with the project title and your name
- Share via email, cloud link, or present on a tablet during meetings

## Final Advice

- **Practice your walkthrough** - Before presenting, rehearse talking through your design from start to finish. Know why you made each decision.
- **Tell the story** - Great presentations are not just about showing drawings. They're about explaining the thinking behind the design.
- **Welcome feedback** - Presenting is a two-way conversation. Be open to questions and suggestions. They often reveal opportunities you hadn't considered.
- **Be proud of your work** - You've built something from scratch using real design thinking. That's worth celebrating, regardless of your experience level.

Your portfolio is more than a collection of pages. It's the record of a design journey - your journey - and presenting it well honors the effort you've invested.
