# Day in the Life Narrative

This exercise invites you to step inside your dream home -- not as a designer reviewing drawings, but as the person who lives there. You'll write a short narrative describing a full day spent in the home you've been designing, from the moment you wake up to the moment you fall asleep.

## Why This Exercise Matters

Floor plans and elevations tell you what a space looks like. A Day in the Life narrative tells you what a space **feels** like. When you walk yourself through a typical day, you uncover things that drawings alone can miss: awkward transitions between rooms, missing storage near the front door, or a kitchen that doesn't catch the morning light the way you imagined.

This exercise connects your design to the human experience of living in it. It transforms abstract square footage into real moments.

## The Exercise

Write a narrative of 400 to 800 words describing a single day in your dream home. Use first person, present tense -- as if you are living it right now. Move through your day naturally and let the spaces unfold around you.

### Prompts to Guide You

Use these questions as starting points. You don't need to answer every one, but let them spark your imagination:

**Morning**
- Where do you wake up? What do you see when you open your eyes?
- What does the light look like in your bedroom at sunrise?
- Where do you go first -- bathroom, kitchen, a quiet spot for coffee?
- What materials are under your feet as you walk through the house?

**Midday**
- Where do you spend most of your working or creative time?
- If someone visits, where do you welcome them?
- Where do you eat lunch? At a counter, a dining table, outside?
- What sounds do you hear? What do you see through the windows?

**Afternoon**
- How do you move between indoor and outdoor spaces?
- Is there a place for hobbies, reading, or exercise?
- Where do children play, pets rest, or guests settle in?
- How does the light shift as the afternoon progresses?

**Evening**
- Where does the family gather at the end of the day?
- What does dinner look like? Who cooks, and where?
- Is there a transition space between the active and quiet parts of the house?
- Where do you go to wind down?

**Night**
- What is the last room you pass through before bed?
- What does your home feel like at night -- the sounds, the darkness, the temperature?
- How does the house settle around you?

### Example Excerpt

> I wake to soft light filtering through the clerestory windows above the bed. The concrete floor is cool under my feet as I pad down the hallway toward the kitchen. I pass the open stairwell where I can hear rain on the metal roof above. In the kitchen, the oak countertop is warm under my hands as I set the kettle down. Through the floor-to-ceiling glass, the garden is just waking up too -- wet leaves, steam rising from the soil.

Notice how this short passage reveals design decisions: clerestory windows, concrete floors, an open stairwell, metal roofing, oak countertops, and floor-to-ceiling glazing. Every sensory detail maps back to the architecture.

## Tips for Writing

1. **Be specific about materials** -- Don't just say "the floor." Say "the wide-plank oak floor" or "the polished concrete." This forces you to make design decisions.

2. **Engage all your senses** -- Sight is obvious, but also consider sound (rain on the roof, echoes in a hallway), touch (cool tile, warm wood), and even smell (fresh air from an open courtyard, coffee in a sunlit kitchen).

3. **Follow your movement** -- Pay attention to how you physically move through the home. Do you pass through a hallway, cross a threshold, climb stairs? These transitions reveal your floor plan.

4. **Note the light** -- Light changes throughout the day. Morning sun enters from the east, afternoon light from the west. Describe how natural light moves through your spaces.

5. **Include other people** -- If you share your home, write them into the narrative. Where are they during your day? How do your paths cross or diverge?

## What to Do With Your Narrative

<DrawerPath>Instead of (or in addition to) writing your narrative, create a sequence of 6-8 sketches showing key moments in your day through your dream home — waking up, making breakfast, working, relaxing in the evening. Annotate each sketch with the materials, light quality, and spatial details you experience in that moment.</DrawerPath>

<BriefPath>Once you've written your Day in the Life, read it alongside your floor plan. Ask yourself:

- Does my layout support the flow I described?
- Are the rooms oriented correctly for the light I imagined?
- Did I describe spaces or features that don't exist in my drawings yet?
- Are there moments in my day that feel awkward or disconnected?

Use any gaps or surprises as prompts to refine your design. This narrative becomes a powerful reference point -- a reminder that architecture is not about the building. It's about the life inside it.</BriefPath>
