# Your Design Philosophy

You have explored what architecture is, studied its foundational principles, looked at how master architects think, and reflected on your own instincts and preferences. Now it is time to bring it all together. In this exercise, you will write your personal design philosophy.

## What Is a Design Philosophy?

A design philosophy is a statement of intent. It describes what you want your space to feel like, function as, and say about you. It is not a list of features or finishes. It is a declaration of values — the ideas and principles that will guide every design decision you make from here forward.

Think of it as the difference between saying "I want a big kitchen" and saying "I want my home to center around the act of cooking and gathering, with materials that feel warm and durable and light that changes throughout the day." The first is a requirement. The second is a philosophy.

## How to Write Yours

### Step 1: Review Your Work So Far

Look back at the exercises you have completed:

- Your **vision statement** or **mood board** from the kickoff
- Your **inspiration questions** responses
- Your notes on the **Vitruvian principles** and **architectural concepts**
- Your reflections on the **master architects**

What themes keep surfacing? What words and images appear again and again? Those patterns are the core of your philosophy.

### Step 2: Answer These Prompts

Write a few sentences for each:

1. **What emotions should your space evoke?** Describe the feelings you want to experience every day in your home. Not just one feeling — think about how different zones might create different moods.

2. **How should function and beauty balance in your ideal space?** Are you drawn to pure minimalism where every object earns its place? Or do you prefer layered, collected spaces where beauty comes from abundance and warmth? Where do you fall on that spectrum?

3. **What principles matter most to you?** Think about the concepts from this module — light, materiality, proportion, context, symmetry, emotional experience. Which ones feel most essential to your vision?

4. **What should your space say about you?** If your home could communicate one thing to anyone who walked through the door, what would it be?

## Architecture Evokes Feeling

Before you begin writing, remember this: what you are creating will evoke a feeling in everyone who enters. An architecturally designed home is completely bespoke — unique, one of a kind. Every proportion, every material, every transition between spaces tells a story that belongs only to you.

The Japanese concept of *Danshari* (断捨離) — the art of decluttering and mindful ordering of space — reminds us that how we organize and maintain our spaces is itself a form of design. The feeling of calm in a well-ordered room is not accidental. It is intentional. Your design philosophy should address not just how spaces look, but how they make people feel — the warmth of arrival, the quiet of a private room, the energy of a kitchen alive with activity.

Carry that awareness into your writing.

### Step 3: Write Your Philosophy

Now weave your answers into a cohesive statement. Aim for one to three paragraphs. Write in your own voice. This is personal — it should sound like you, not like a textbook.

Your design philosophy might begin with your values, move through the specific qualities you want your space to embody, and end with the kind of life your space should support.

### Step 4: Let It Sit

After writing, step away for a day if you can. Come back and read it fresh. Does it still ring true? Does anything feel forced or missing? Revise until it feels honest.

> Write your own philosophy of space. What do you believe about how a home should feel? What values should it embody? What does your space say about the life you want to live?

## What to Do With It

<DrawerPath>Instead of writing your philosophy in paragraphs, express it visually. Create a single-page sketch that captures your design values — draw the kinds of spaces you want to create, annotate with key words, and use arrows or symbols to show relationships between your priorities.</DrawerPath>

<BriefPath>Your design philosophy becomes a reference document for the rest of this course. When you sketch floor plans, choose materials, evaluate design trade-offs, or consider a new idea, return to your philosophy and ask: does this choice align with what I said matters? This document will evolve. As you learn more, you may refine your values or discover new priorities. That is not inconsistency. That is growth. Update your philosophy whenever it needs it.</BriefPath>

## Your Philosophy Is a Living Document

Your design philosophy is not carved in stone. It is a compass, not a contract. As you move through the remaining modules — learning about spatial elements, materials, environmental design, and construction — your understanding will deepen. Ideas that feel essential now may evolve. New priorities may emerge.

That is exactly how it should work. Return to your philosophy at the end of each module and ask: does this still feel true? Would I change anything? The strongest design philosophies are the ones that grow with you.

The act of writing it down, even imperfectly, is what matters. It forces you to articulate what you care about — and that clarity will guide every decision you make from here.
