# Inspiration from the Masters

Theory comes alive when you see it in practice. The architects in this lesson represent different philosophies, eras, and approaches, but they all share one thing: a deep commitment to the principles you have been learning. Studying their work will sharpen your eye and expand your sense of what architecture can be.

## Frank Gehry

Frank Gehry is known for buildings that look like nothing else on earth — sculptural, folded, sometimes almost crumpled forms that seem to defy the logic of construction. But beneath the dramatic shapes is a rigorous thinker driven by curiosity. Gehry's work explores how folds and curves can create unexpected interior spaces filled with soft, diffused light. His buildings are emotional experiences as much as they are functional ones.

What to notice: how Gehry uses form to create emotional responses, and how even his most radical exteriors serve the experience of the people inside.

## Mies van der Rohe

Ludwig Mies van der Rohe is one of the defining figures of modern architecture. His famous principle — "less is more" — shaped an entire movement. Mies stripped buildings down to their essential elements: steel, glass, and open space. His work demonstrates that simplicity is not emptiness. It is precision. Every material, every joint, every proportion in a Mies building is deliberate.

What to notice: how Mies uses proportion, material honesty, and open floor plans to create spaces that feel both minimal and rich.

## Angelo Candalepas

Angelo Candalepas brings a deeply considered, internationally informed perspective to contemporary architecture. His work draws on historical references from across cultures and eras, synthesizing them into buildings that feel both timeless and of their place. Candalepas pays extraordinary attention to materiality and craft, creating buildings where every surface and detail is intentional.

What to notice: how Candalepas balances historical awareness with modern design, and how his material choices create a sense of permanence and care.

## Luigi Rosselli

Luigi Rosselli is known for residential architecture that engages powerfully with landscape and site. His projects often feature inventive use of materials and a sensitivity to the specific conditions of each location — light, climate, topography, and views. Rosselli's work demonstrates that great residential architecture is always in dialogue with its surroundings.

What to notice: how Rosselli responds to site conditions, and how his homes create connections between interior space and the natural environment.

## Go Deeper

One of the best things you can do to develop your architectural eye is to watch architects talk about their own work. Here are some ways to continue exploring:

- **Virtual architecture tours on YouTube** — Search for walkthroughs of famous buildings and homes. Seeing spaces in motion reveals what photographs cannot.
- **Harvard GSD lectures** — The Graduate School of Design publishes many of its lectures online. These give you access to how leading architects think and talk about their work.
- **Bjarke Ingels talks** — Bjarke Ingels of BIG (Bjarke Ingels Group) is one of the most engaging speakers in contemporary architecture. His talks are accessible, visual, and full of ideas about how architecture can be playful, practical, and ambitious at the same time.

## Reflect

As you explore these architects and others, keep your own principles in mind. Notice how the Vitruvian pillars — firmness, commodity, delight — appear in each project. Notice where architects break conventions and why. Ask yourself which approaches resonate with your own design instincts.

Your design philosophy is not built in isolation. It is shaped by the work you study, the spaces you inhabit, and the questions you ask. The masters are not here to be copied. They are here to be learned from.
