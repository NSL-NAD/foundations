# Inspiration from the Masters

Theory comes alive when you see it in practice. The architects in this lesson represent different philosophies, eras, and approaches, but they all share one thing: a deep commitment to the principles you have been learning. Studying their work will sharpen your eye and expand your sense of what architecture can be.

## Frank Gehry

Frank Gehry is known for buildings that look like nothing else on earth — sculptural, folded, sometimes almost crumpled forms that seem to defy the logic of construction. But beneath the dramatic shapes is a rigorous thinker driven by curiosity. Gehry's work explores how folds and curves can create unexpected interior spaces filled with soft, diffused light. His buildings are emotional experiences as much as they are functional ones.

What to notice: how Gehry uses form to create emotional responses, and how even his most radical exteriors serve the experience of the people inside.

## Mies van der Rohe

Ludwig Mies van der Rohe is one of the defining figures of modern architecture. His famous principle — "less is more" — shaped an entire movement. Mies stripped buildings down to their essential elements: steel, glass, and open space. His work demonstrates that simplicity is not emptiness. It is precision. Every material, every joint, every proportion in a Mies building is deliberate.

What to notice: how Mies uses proportion, material honesty, and open floor plans to create spaces that feel both minimal and rich.

## Angelo Candalepas

Angelo Candalepas brings a deeply considered, internationally informed perspective to contemporary architecture. His work draws on historical references from across cultures and eras, synthesizing them into buildings that feel both timeless and of their place. Candalepas pays extraordinary attention to materiality and craft, creating buildings where every surface and detail is intentional.

What to notice: how Candalepas balances historical awareness with modern design, and how his material choices create a sense of permanence and care.

## Luigi Rosselli

Luigi Rosselli is known for residential architecture that engages powerfully with landscape and site. His projects often feature inventive use of materials and a sensitivity to the specific conditions of each location — light, climate, topography, and views. Rosselli's work demonstrates that great residential architecture is always in dialogue with its surroundings.

What to notice: how Rosselli responds to site conditions, and how his homes create connections between interior space and the natural environment.

## Zaha Hadid

Zaha Hadid was a visionary who proved that buildings could be fluid, dynamic, and gravity-defying. Born in Baghdad and trained in London, she became the first woman to win the Pritzker Prize. Her buildings sweep and curve in ways that seem almost impossible, yet they are rigorously engineered. Hadid's work challenges the assumption that architecture must be made of right angles and flat planes.

What to notice: how Hadid uses flowing forms to create a sense of continuous movement, and how her interiors often feel like being inside a living organism rather than a static structure.

## Tadao Ando

Tadao Ando is a self-taught Japanese architect whose work proves that simplicity can be the most powerful form of expression. His buildings are studies in concrete, light, and geometry. Ando strips architecture down to essential forms and then uses natural light to bring them alive. His spaces are contemplative, almost spiritual, creating a profound sense of calm.

What to notice: how Ando uses bare concrete not as a cold industrial material but as something warm and meditative, and how carefully placed openings transform light into the primary decoration.

## Glenn Murcutt

Glenn Murcutt designs buildings that are in deep conversation with the Australian landscape. Working largely alone, without a large firm, Murcutt creates homes and small buildings that respond to sun, wind, rain, and terrain with extraordinary precision. His famous principle — "touch the earth lightly" — captures his commitment to environmental sensitivity and minimal impact.

What to notice: how Murcutt's buildings are tuned to their specific site conditions like instruments, and how simple materials like corrugated steel and timber become elegant when used with intention.

## Go Deeper

One of the best things you can do to develop your architectural eye is to watch architects talk about their own work. Here are some ways to continue exploring:

- **Virtual architecture tours on YouTube** — Search for walkthroughs of famous buildings and homes. Seeing spaces in motion reveals what photographs cannot.
- **Harvard GSD lectures** — The Graduate School of Design publishes many of its lectures online. These give you access to how leading architects think and talk about their work.
- **Bjarke Ingels talks** — Bjarke Ingels of BIG (Bjarke Ingels Group) is one of the most engaging speakers in contemporary architecture. His talks are accessible, visual, and full of ideas about how architecture can be playful, practical, and ambitious at the same time.

## Reflect

As you explore these architects and others, keep your own principles in mind. Notice how the Vitruvian pillars — firmness, commodity, delight — appear in each project. Notice where architects break conventions and why. Ask yourself which approaches resonate with your own design instincts.

Your design philosophy is not built in isolation. It is shaped by the work you study, the spaces you inhabit, and the questions you ask. The masters are not here to be copied. They are here to be learned from.
