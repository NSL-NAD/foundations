# Module 1 Review Checklist

Use this checklist to confirm you have absorbed the key ideas from Module 1 before moving on. If any item feels unclear, revisit the relevant lesson. There is no rush — solid foundations make everything that follows easier.

## Core Understanding

- [ ] I understand that architecture is more than buildings — it is the practice of shaping human experience through space, material, and form
- [ ] I can explain the concept of subconscious trust and how spaces can create an instinctive sense of comfort and belonging
- [ ] I recognize that nature has always served as a source of architectural inspiration and logic

## The Vitruvian Principles

- [ ] I can define **Firmitas** (structural integrity) and identify examples of it in everyday buildings
- [ ] I can define **Utilitas** (usefulness and function) and explain why a beautiful space that does not work is a failed design
- [ ] I can define **Venustas** (beauty and delight) and describe how proportion, light, and material create emotional responses
- [ ] I understand why all three principles must work together, not in isolation

## Architectural Concepts

- [ ] I have a working understanding of these key ideas: space and meaning, form and proportion, scale, light and shadow, texture and materiality, rhythm and repetition, symmetry and asymmetry
- [ ] I understand the emotional experience of place and why designing for feeling matters as much as designing for function
- [ ] I am aware of the 15% rule and how creative freedom operates within practical constraints
- [ ] I understand the importance of designing in context with the surrounding environment

## Inspiration

- [ ] I have explored the work of at least two master architects discussed in this module
- [ ] I have reflected on which architectural approaches resonate with my own instincts and preferences

## Personal Design Work

- [ ] I have written my personal design philosophy
- [ ] My design philosophy addresses what I want my space to feel like, function as, and say about me

## Brief Builder Reflection

Before moving on, take a moment to connect Module 1 to your design brief. Write a few sentences for each:

1. **What is the single most important feeling you want your home to create?** Revisit your design philosophy — does your answer still align with what you wrote?
2. **Which architectural concept from this module surprised or inspired you most?** How might it show up in your design?
3. **Which master architect's approach resonates most with your vision?** What specifically about their work speaks to you?
4. **What is one constraint you are already aware of** (budget, site, climate, household needs) **and how might you turn it into a design opportunity?**

## Self-Check

Ask yourself: **Can I articulate what I want my space to feel like?** If you can answer that question clearly and with conviction, you are ready for Module 2.
