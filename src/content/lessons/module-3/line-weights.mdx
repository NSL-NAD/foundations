# Line Weights+

Architectural drawings are a universal language. Architects, builders, and engineers around the world use the same set of conventions to communicate design intent clearly and without ambiguity. In this lesson, you'll learn the foundational rules of that language: line weights, symbols, and labeling.

## Line Weights

Not all lines in an architectural drawing are equal. The thickness (or "weight") of a line tells the viewer what it represents and how important it is in the drawing. Mastering line weights is one of the fastest ways to make your drawings look professional and readable.

### Thick Lines: Cut Objects

The heaviest lines in your drawing represent objects that are being cut through by the drawing plane. In a floor plan, this means walls. Because the plan is an imaginary horizontal slice through the building, walls appear as solid, thick lines. These are the most prominent elements in any plan drawing.

### Medium Lines: Surfaces Beyond

Elements that are visible but sit behind or beyond the cut plane are drawn with medium-weight lines. Think of countertops, floor patterns, or furniture. These elements are important for context, but they shouldn't compete visually with the walls.

### Thin Lines: Details and Dimensions

The lightest lines are used for dimension lines, notes, hatching patterns, and other supporting information. These keep the drawing informative without cluttering the main geometry.

### Dashed Lines: Hidden or Overhead Elements

Dashed lines indicate elements you can't see directly in the current view. In a floor plan, dashed lines commonly show overhead elements like upper kitchen cabinets, beams above, or skylights. The dashes tell the viewer, "This exists, but it's above or behind what you're looking at."

## Common Symbols

Architectural drawings use standardized symbols so that anyone reading the drawing understands what each element represents.

![Architectural door symbol in plan view](/images/symbols/door-symbol.jpg)
![Window symbol in architectural plan](/images/symbols/window-symbol.jpg)
![Stair symbol with direction arrow](/images/symbols/stairs-symbol.jpg)
![Kitchen and bath fixture symbols](/images/symbols/fixtures-symbol.jpg)

- **Doors** are shown as a line (the door panel) with an arc indicating the direction and range of the swing.
- **Windows** appear as thin parallel lines within the wall, sometimes with a single line between them representing the glass.
- **Stairs** are drawn as a series of parallel lines (treads) with an arrow showing the direction of travel, pointing upward from the current floor level.
- **Appliances and fixtures** like sinks, toilets, and stoves have their own simplified symbols that suggest their shape and function.

## Labeling

A well-drawn plan without labels is incomplete. Clear labeling removes guesswork. When someone picks up your drawing, they should be able to understand every space and element without asking you a single question.

### Room Labels

Every room should be clearly named: "Living Room," "Kitchen," "Bedroom 1," and so on. Professional drawings often include room dimensions and floor finish type below the name. For example:

- **Living Room** - 14' x 18' - Hardwood
- **Kitchen** - 12' x 16' - Tile
- **Bedroom 1** - 12' x 14' - Carpet

### Door and Window Tags

Doors and windows should be tagged with numbered references that link to a schedule. A door might be labeled "D1" with a circle around it, referring to a door schedule that lists the size, type, and hardware. Windows follow the same convention: "W1," "W2," and so on.

### Dimension Strings

Dimension lines run along the outside of the floor plan (and sometimes inside for key interior dimensions). Follow these guidelines for consistent dimensioning:

- Outer dimension string: overall building length and width
- Middle dimension string: distances between major wall faces
- Inner dimension string: individual room widths, window and door locations
- Always dimension from face of stud to face of stud (not finish to finish)
- Keep dimension text above the dimension line, reading from the bottom or right side

### Section Cut Markers

When you want to show where a section is cut through the building, place section cut markers on the plan. These are typically circles with an arrow pointing in the viewing direction, labeled with a letter or number (like "A" or "1") and a reference to the sheet where the section drawing appears.

### Elevation Reference Markers

Similar to section markers, elevation references show which direction an exterior or interior elevation is looking. These help the reader navigate between different drawing types.

### North Arrows

Every site plan and floor plan should include a north arrow. This orients the reader and tells them where the sun rises (east) and sets (west) relative to the building. Standard practice places the arrow in the upper-right area of the drawing, though any consistent location works.

### Scale Notation

Always note the scale of your drawing. Common residential scales include 1/4" = 1'0" for floor plans and 1/8" = 1'0" for site plans. The scale tells anyone reading the drawing how to measure distances accurately.

## Why This Matters

These conventions exist because architecture is a collaborative discipline. Your drawings will be read by engineers, contractors, clients, and permitting officials. When you follow the established conventions for line weights, symbols, and labeling, your drawings speak a language that everyone in the building industry understands.

As you begin your own drawings in the exercises ahead, keep these conventions in mind. They'll transform your sketches from personal notes into professional communication tools.
