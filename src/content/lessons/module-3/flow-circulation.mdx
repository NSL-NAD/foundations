# Flow and Circulation

Drawing skills become truly powerful when they're connected to design thinking. In this lesson, you'll learn four essential concepts that bridge the gap between technical drawing and thoughtful architecture: flow and circulation, zoning, orientation, and the scale of furniture.

## Flow and Circulation

Flow describes how people move naturally through spaces. Good circulation feels effortless. You walk from the front door to the kitchen without bumping into furniture. You move from the bedroom to the bathroom without crossing through the living room. You carry groceries from the garage to the kitchen counter in a straight, logical path.

Bad circulation creates friction. Awkward hallways, dead-end rooms, and crossed paths all make a home feel frustrating to live in, even if each individual room is well-designed.

When you look at your floor plan, trace the most common daily routes with your finger:

- Front door to kitchen
- Bedroom to bathroom
- Kitchen to dining area
- Garage to kitchen
- Living room to outdoor space

Each of these paths should be direct, obvious, and free of unnecessary obstacles. If you find yourself weaving through multiple rooms or navigating tight pinch points, the circulation needs work.

## Zoning

Zoning is the practice of grouping rooms by their function and noise level. A well-zoned home separates public spaces from private ones, and active areas from quiet ones.

**Public zone**: Living room, dining room, kitchen, entry, guest bathroom. These are the spaces where guests are welcomed and daily family activity happens. They tend to be louder, more active, and more connected to each other.

**Private zone**: Bedrooms, master bathroom, home office, personal retreats. These spaces need quiet and separation from the bustle of the public zone.

**Service zone**: Laundry, mudroom, garage, mechanical room, storage. These functional spaces support the household but don't need to be prominently visible.

On your floor plan, you should be able to draw a rough boundary around each zone. If public and private spaces are tangled together, consider reorganizing.

## Orientation

Orientation is about aligning your rooms with the path of the sun to enhance their function and comfort.

- **East-facing rooms** receive morning light. This is ideal for kitchens and breakfast areas where you want bright, energizing light to start the day.
- **South-facing rooms** get the most consistent daylight throughout the day. Living rooms and main gathering spaces benefit from this steady, warm light.
- **West-facing rooms** receive afternoon and evening sun, which can be intense and warm. Be thoughtful about placing bedrooms here unless you enjoy sunset views.
- **North-facing rooms** get soft, indirect light. This works well for offices, studios, and spaces where you want even, glare-free illumination.

Refer back to the north arrow on your site plan and think about how each room in your floor plan relates to the sun's path.

## Scale of Furniture

One of the quickest ways to test whether a room actually works is to sketch basic furniture in plan view. Draw simple rectangles to represent common pieces:

- **King bed**: 6'6" x 6'8"
- **Queen bed**: 5'0" x 6'8"
- **Sofa**: 3'0" x 7'0"
- **Dining table (seats 6)**: 3'6" x 6'0"
- **Desk**: 2'6" x 5'0"
- **Toilet**: 1'6" x 2'6"
- **Bathtub**: 2'6" x 5'0"

Place these shapes in your rooms and check: Is there enough space to walk around the bed? Can you pull a dining chair out without hitting the wall? Is there room for a coffee table in front of the sofa? If the furniture doesn't fit comfortably, the room may need to be larger, or the layout may need to be rethought.

## Connecting Drawing to Design

These four concepts, flow, zoning, orientation, and furniture scale, are what transform a collection of rooms into a home that truly works. They connect the mechanical skill of drawing to the creative practice of design. As you continue refining your floor plans and site plans, keep these ideas at the front of your mind. Good architecture is not just about how a building looks. It's about how it lives.
