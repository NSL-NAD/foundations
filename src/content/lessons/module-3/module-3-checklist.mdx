# Module 3 Checklist

Use this checklist to confirm you've absorbed the key skills and concepts from the Drawing Foundations module before moving on.

## Knowledge Check

- **Drawing tools**: Can you identify and use the basic drawing tools, including an architectural scale, straightedge, triangles, compass, and mechanical pencil?
- **Line weights**: Do you understand the difference between thick lines (cut objects), medium lines (surfaces beyond), thin lines (details), and dashed lines (hidden or overhead elements)?
- **Drawing conventions**: Are you comfortable with standard symbols for doors, windows, and stairs?
- **Labeling**: Do you consistently label every room, door, and major feature on your drawings?

## Drawing Practice

- **Site plan**: Have you drawn a site plan showing a building footprint on a lot with compass orientation, property lines, access points, and landscape features?
- **Floor plan**: Have you drafted a floor plan at 1/4" = 1'0" scale with properly weighted walls, doors, windows, furniture, and room labels?
- **Elevation**: Have you drawn a front elevation showing the building's face, roofline, window and door placement, and height dimensions?
- **Section**: Have you drawn a building section showing the vertical cut through a main room with floor thickness, wall height, ceiling height, and roof structure?

## Design Thinking

- **Flow and circulation**: Can you trace the major paths through your floor plan and confirm they are direct and logical?
- **Zoning**: Have you organized your rooms into public, private, and service zones?
- **Orientation**: Have you considered how natural light from the sun affects each room based on its compass direction?
- **Furniture scale**: Have you tested your room sizes by sketching basic furniture in plan view?

## Mini Project

Create a coordinated drawing set for your dream home concept that includes:

1. A basic **site plan** showing the building on its lot with compass orientation, driveway, and walkway
2. A **floor plan** with all rooms labeled, doors and windows placed, and furniture sketched lightly
3. One **front elevation** showing the building's face, roofline, and key proportions

These three drawings should work together as a unified set. The building footprint on the site plan should match the floor plan outline. The windows and doors on the elevation should align with their positions on the floor plan.

This mini project is your first step toward thinking like an architect: seeing a building not as a single drawing, but as a coordinated set of views that together describe a complete design.
