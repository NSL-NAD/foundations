# Elevations

An elevation drawing reveals the face of a building. While floor plans show how a home works on the inside, elevations show how it looks from the outside. In this exercise, you'll learn what elevations communicate and then draw one yourself.

## What Is an Elevation?

An elevation is a straight-on, flattened view of one side of a building. There's no perspective, no vanishing points, and no depth distortion. It's as if you stood directly in front of the building, perfectly centered, and traced its outline onto a flat sheet of glass.

Most buildings have four elevations: front, rear, left side, and right side. Each one tells a different story about the building's character.

## Why Elevations Matter

Elevations let you visualize the facade, the height of the building, the placement of windows and doors, the proportions of walls to openings, and the materials used on the exterior. They answer questions that a floor plan cannot: How tall is the building? What does the roofline look like? Are the windows balanced and well-proportioned? Does the front door feel welcoming?

Elevations are also where you begin to see the personality of the home. A low, horizontal elevation with wide windows feels modern and grounded. A tall elevation with steep roof pitches and narrow windows feels traditional and sheltering. The choices you make here define the first impression your home creates.

## Key Elements of an Elevation

When drawing an elevation, include these elements:

1. **Ground line** - A horizontal line at the base representing the ground level
2. **Exterior walls** - The outline of the building's face, drawn with medium-weight lines
3. **Roof profile** - The shape of the roof as seen from this side, including overhangs and eaves
4. **Windows and doors** - Placed accurately based on their positions in the floor plan, drawn with thinner lines showing frames and panels
5. **Height dimensions** - Note key heights like floor-to-ceiling, total building height, and window sill and head heights
6. **Material indications** - Light hatching or notes to suggest siding, stone, brick, or other exterior finishes

## Exercise: Draw Your Front Elevation

<DrawerPath>

Using your floor plan as a reference, draw the front elevation of your dream home.

### Steps

1. **Establish the ground line.** Draw a horizontal line across your page. This is grade level, the surface of the earth where the building meets the ground.

2. **Draw the overall outline.** Using your floor plan's front wall as a guide, draw the width of the building. Then draw the wall height. Standard residential wall height is 9 feet (9 grid squares at 1/4" scale). Add the roof shape above, whether it's a gable, hip, flat, or shed roof.

3. **Place windows and doors.** Refer to your floor plan to locate each window and door along this wall. Transfer their positions accurately. Standard door height is 6'8" to 7'0". Window sill heights are typically 3'0" above the floor, and window head heights align with the door heads.

4. **Add the roof.** Draw the roofline, including any overhangs. A typical roof overhang extends 1 to 2 feet beyond the wall face. Show the thickness of the roof edge.

5. **Indicate materials.** Use light notes or simple hatching to suggest what the exterior walls are made of. You don't need to draw every brick or board, just enough to convey the intention.

6. **Add dimensions.** Note the overall height, floor-to-ceiling height, and any other key vertical measurements.

7. **Label the drawing.** Title it "Front Elevation" and include the scale (1/4" = 1'0").

<BriefPath>

Write an **Exterior Character Description** in your notebook. Describe what your dream home looks like from the front:

1. Overall form and height — single story spread low, or multiple stories rising tall?
2. Roof shape — flat, gable, hip, shed?
3. Window pattern — large expanses of glass or smaller, rhythmic openings?
4. Front door treatment — recessed, prominent, covered?
5. Materials visible on the facade
6. The overall first impression a visitor gets approaching your home

## Reflection

Compare your elevation to your floor plan. Do the windows in the elevation line up with the windows in the plan? Does the front door look proportional to the wall around it? Does the overall shape feel intentional and balanced? If something looks off, adjust it. Elevations and plans work together, and changes in one often require updates in the other.
