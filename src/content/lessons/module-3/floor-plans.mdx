# Floor Plans

The floor plan is the single most important drawing in residential architecture. It defines how people live in, move through, and experience a home. In this exercise, you'll learn what a floor plan communicates and then draft your first one.

## What Is a Floor Plan?

A floor plan is a horizontal "slice" through a building, taken at about 4 feet above the floor. Imagine removing the top half of the building and looking straight down at what remains. You'd see walls, doors, windows, stairs, and the layout of every room. That's a floor plan.

## Why Floor Plans Matter

The floor plan establishes how people move through the home. It defines function and flow. Where is the kitchen relative to the dining area? Can you get from the garage to the kitchen without walking through the living room? Is the master bedroom private and separated from guest spaces?

Every decision about room placement, hallway width, door location, and window position plays out in the floor plan first. If the plan doesn't work, the house doesn't work, no matter how beautiful the exterior looks.

## Key Drawing Conventions

As you draw, apply the line weight conventions you learned earlier:

- **Walls** are drawn with thick lines (they're cut by the plan)
- **Doors** show the panel and swing arc
- **Windows** appear as thin parallel lines within the wall
- **Furniture** is drawn lightly to check room sizing without dominating the drawing

## Tips on Room Sizing

Getting room sizes right is critical for a floor plan that feels realistic. Here are some common residential room dimensions to guide you:

- **Living room**: 14' x 18' to 16' x 22' for a comfortable family space
- **Kitchen**: 10' x 12' minimum, larger if it includes an island or eat-in area
- **Dining room**: 12' x 14' comfortably seats six to eight people
- **Master bedroom**: 14' x 16' is generous, 12' x 14' is comfortable
- **Secondary bedrooms**: 10' x 12' to 12' x 14'
- **Bathrooms**: 5' x 8' for a standard full bath, 3' x 6' for a half bath
- **Hallways**: 3'6" minimum width, 4' is more comfortable
- **Doors**: Standard interior doors are 2'8" or 3'0" wide

## Room Adjacencies

Think carefully about which rooms should be near each other and which should be separated:

- The **kitchen** should be adjacent to the **dining area** and easy to reach from the **garage** (for carrying groceries)
- **Bedrooms** should be grouped together, away from noisy public spaces
- **Bathrooms** should be near bedrooms and accessible from public areas without walking through private ones
- The **laundry room** benefits from being close to bedrooms where dirty clothes originate

## Exercise: Draft Your Floor Plan

Using your grid paper at 1/4" = 1'0" scale, draw the floor plan for your dream home.

### Steps

1. **Start with the exterior walls.** Draw the overall footprint of your home using thick lines. Keep the shape simple for your first plan, a rectangle or an L-shape works well.

2. **Divide the interior.** Add interior walls to create rooms. Start with the major spaces (living, kitchen, bedrooms) and then fill in secondary spaces (bathrooms, closets, hallways).

3. **Place doors and windows.** Add doors with swing arcs showing which way they open. Place windows along exterior walls, thinking about views and natural light from your site plan.

4. **Check room sizes.** Count the grid squares to verify your rooms are realistically sized using the guidelines above.

5. **Add furniture lightly.** Sketch simple rectangles for beds, couches, tables, and appliances. This helps you verify that rooms are large enough for their intended use.

6. **Label every room.** Write the name of each space directly on the plan: "Kitchen," "Living Room," "Bedroom 1," and so on.

7. **Draw the flow.** Trace the path someone would take from the front door to the kitchen, from the bedroom to the bathroom, from the garage to the house. Do these paths make sense? Are they direct and logical?

<BriefPath>

Write a **Room-by-Room Spatial Program** in your notebook. For each room in your dream home, describe:

1. Room name and purpose
2. Approximate dimensions
3. What rooms it should be adjacent to and why
4. Key furniture it needs to fit
5. Where natural light should come from
6. Any special requirements

Organize your rooms into Public, Private, and Service zones.

## Reflection

Step back and look at your floor plan as a whole. Does the layout feel intuitive? Can you imagine living in this home and moving through it comfortably? If something feels awkward, redraw that section. The beauty of working on paper is that iteration costs nothing but a few minutes and a clean sheet.
