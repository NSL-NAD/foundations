# Sections

If a floor plan is a horizontal cut through a building, a section is a vertical one. Sections reveal the hidden interior relationships that no other drawing type can show. In this exercise, you'll learn what sections communicate and then draw a simple one.

## What Is a Section?

A section is a drawing created by making an imaginary vertical cut through a building and looking at what's exposed. You slice through walls, floors, ceilings, and the roof, then draw everything you see. The result shows the interior relationships between floors, the height of spaces, the thickness of structural elements, and how the building connects to the ground.

## Why Sections Matter

Sections help you understand the vertical dimension of architecture, something that plans and elevations only hint at. How tall is the living room ceiling? Is there a step down into the family room? How does the second floor relate to the first? Where does the roof structure sit, and how much space does it take up?

These vertical relationships have a profound effect on how a space feels. A room with a 14-foot ceiling feels dramatically different from one with an 8-foot ceiling, even if both rooms have the same floor plan dimensions. Sections are where you design that experience.

## Key Elements of a Section

A well-drawn section includes:

1. **Cut elements** - Walls, floors, and roof structure that are sliced through, drawn with the thickest lines (just like cut walls in a floor plan)
2. **Elements beyond** - Interior walls, furniture, and details visible behind the cut plane, drawn with thinner lines
3. **Ground and foundation** - The earth beneath the building and the foundation system sitting on it
4. **Floor thickness** - The structural depth of each floor, typically 10 to 14 inches for wood-framed residential construction
5. **Ceiling heights** - The clear distance from finished floor to finished ceiling in each room
6. **Roof structure** - Rafters, trusses, or beams that form the roof, along with insulation space
7. **Vertical dimensions** - Height annotations for floors, ceilings, and overall building height

## Exercise: Draw a Building Section

Choose a location to cut through your dream home floor plan, preferably through a main living space where you can show interesting vertical relationships.

### Steps

1. **Mark the cut line on your plan.** On your floor plan, draw a dashed line showing where the section cuts through the building. Cut through a main room for the most informative view.

2. **Draw the ground line.** Start your section drawing with a horizontal ground line, just like in the elevation.

3. **Draw the foundation.** Below the ground line, sketch a simple foundation wall or slab, typically 8 to 12 inches thick, extending below grade.

4. **Build up the floor.** Draw the first floor structure above the foundation. Show the floor thickness as a band roughly 10 to 12 inches deep.

5. **Draw the walls.** From the floor, draw the exterior and interior walls that your section line cuts through. Use thick lines for these cut elements. Standard wall thickness is about 6 inches for exterior walls and 4.5 inches for interior walls.

6. **Set the ceiling height.** Draw the ceiling at the appropriate height. Standard residential ceiling height is 8 to 9 feet. If you want a dramatic space, go higher.

7. **Add the roof.** Draw the roof structure above the ceiling. Show rafters or trusses, and indicate the insulation space between the ceiling and the roof.

8. **Fill in elements beyond.** Draw any interior walls, doorways, or furniture visible behind the cut plane using thinner lines.

9. **Add dimensions.** Note floor-to-ceiling heights, overall building height, floor thickness, and any level changes.

10. **Label the drawing.** Title it "Section A-A" (or whatever you named your cut line) and include the scale.

## Reflection

Your section should tell the story of what it feels like to stand inside your home. Does the ceiling height feel right for each space? Can you see how the structure holds the building up? Does the relationship between the ground, the floor, the walls, and the roof make sense as a unified system? If something feels disconnected, revisit it and refine.
