# Designing Something That Can Actually Be Built

You've learned to translate ideas to paper. Now let's talk about translating paper to reality.

Every beautiful sketch must eventually answer a practical question: *Can this actually stand up?*

This isn't about becoming a structural engineer — that's what licensed professionals are for. But understanding basic structural principles will help you:

- Avoid designing something impossible (or impossibly expensive)
- Communicate more effectively with architects and engineers
- Understand why professionals might push back on certain ideas
- Make informed tradeoffs between vision and practicality

## How Buildings Stand Up: The Basics

### Gravity Loads (Vertical Forces)

Everything has weight. Your roof pushes down on your walls. Your walls push down on your foundation. Your foundation pushes down on the earth. The path these forces travel is called the **load path**, and it must be continuous from roof to ground.

### Lateral Loads (Horizontal Forces)

Wind pushes against your walls. Earthquakes shake your foundation. These sideways forces require **bracing** — shear walls, diagonal bracing, or rigid frames that prevent the building from racking (leaning over like a parallelogram).

### Key Structural Vocabulary

| Term | What It Means | Why You Care |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| **Load-bearing wall** | A wall that supports weight from above | You can't just remove it during renovation |
| **Header / Lintel** | Beam above window or door opening | Larger openings need bigger headers |
| **Span** | Distance a beam or joist covers without support | Longer spans need deeper beams |
| **Point load** | Weight concentrated at one spot | Requires support directly below |
| **Foundation** | Structure transferring building weight to earth | Different soils need different foundations |
| **Shear wall** | Wall designed to resist lateral forces | Often limits where you can place large windows |

## The Span Problem

Here's a rule of thumb that will save you headaches:

**The wider you want to span without columns, the deeper (and more expensive) your beams must be.**

That gorgeous 30-foot living room with no columns? Possible — but it requires either:

- A very deep beam (which affects ceiling height above)
- An engineered steel beam (expensive)
- A truss system (affects the floor or roof above)

### Rough Span Guidelines (Wood Construction)

| Span | Typical Solution |
|------|------------------|
| Up to 12' | Standard dimensional lumber joists |
| 12-20' | Engineered lumber (LVL, I-joists) |
| 20-30' | Steel beams or engineered trusses |
| 30'+ | Consult a structural engineer early |

**Design Implication:** If your floor plan shows a 25-foot-wide great room, you need to think about what's holding up the floor or roof above that space — *before* you fall in love with the design.

## When Dreams Meet Reality: Common Issues

**"I want a wall of windows facing the view."**
Reality: You still need lateral bracing somewhere. Solutions include moment frames (expensive), bracing at corners, or accepting some solid wall sections.

**"I want a cantilevered deck extending over the hillside."**
Reality: Cantilevers work, but the rule of thumb is you need 2x the "backspan" inside the building to support 1x the cantilever outside. A 10-foot cantilever needs 20 feet of structure behind it.

**"I want an open floor plan — no walls between kitchen and living room."**
Reality: Usually fine, but someone needs to verify which walls are load-bearing. Open plans often require a beam where the wall used to be.

**"I want a rooftop deck."**
Reality: Roofs designed for snow loads aren't necessarily designed for people, furniture, and hot tubs. Structure may need upgrading.

## When to Consult a Structural Engineer

- Any span over 20 feet
- Removing or modifying existing walls
- Building on a slope or challenging soil
- Cantilevers or unusual geometries
- Adding floors to existing structures
- Seismic zones (much of the western US)
- Hurricane zones (coastal areas)
- Any design that makes a contractor say "hmm"

**Cost Reality:** Structural engineering for a custom home typically runs $3,000-$15,000 depending on complexity. This is money well spent — it's far cheaper than fixing structural problems during or after construction.

## The Foundation Question

Your dream home's foundation depends on:

1. **Soil conditions** — Clay expands and contracts; sand drains but may shift; rock is stable but expensive to excavate
2. **Water table** — High groundwater affects basement feasibility
3. **Frost depth** — Foundations must extend below the frost line
4. **Slope** — Steep sites may need specialized foundations

### Common Foundation Types

| Type | Best For | Limitations |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Slab-on-grade | Flat sites, warm climates, budget builds | No basement, limited for slopes |
| Crawl space | Moderate slopes, access to utilities | Can have moisture issues |
| Full basement | Cold climates, flat sites, extra living space | Expensive, not for high water tables |
| Pier and post | Steep slopes, flood zones, minimal site disturbance | Limited for heavy structures |

## Exercise

Look at your Module 3 floor plan sketch. Identify:

1. Your longest span (room width with no intermediate support)
2. Any walls that might be load-bearing
3. Any cantilevers or dramatic overhangs

Write a note about each: Is this buildable with standard construction, or does it need engineering attention?
