# Site Plans

A site plan is one of the most important drawings in architecture, and it's often the very first one created. In this exercise, you'll learn what a site plan communicates and then draw one of your own.

## What Is a Site Plan?

A site plan is a top-down view that shows a building in the context of its surrounding site. Think of it as looking straight down from above, like a bird or a satellite. The drawing includes the building footprint along with key site features: the landscape, roads, driveways, walkways, neighboring structures, and natural elements like trees or water.

## Why Site Plans Matter

The site plan helps you make critical early decisions about placement, orientation, and connection to the environment. Where does the building sit on the lot? How do people approach the front door? Where does the sun rise and set relative to the rooms inside? How does the home relate to the street, the neighbors, and the landscape?

These questions shape the entire design. A well-placed building takes advantage of natural light, views, breezes, and privacy. A poorly placed building fights against all of them.

## Key Elements of a Site Plan

Before you start drawing, make sure you understand the elements that belong on a site plan:

1. **Property lines** - The legal boundaries of the lot, typically drawn as a dashed or dash-dot line
2. **Building footprint** - The outline of the building as seen from above, drawn with thick lines
3. **Compass orientation** - A north arrow that shows which direction is north, which tells you where the sun will be throughout the day
4. **Access points** - Driveways, walkways, and paths that show how people and vehicles reach the building
5. **Setbacks** - The required distances between the building and the property lines, often dictated by local building codes
6. **Landscape features** - Trees, gardens, slopes, and other natural elements that affect or enhance the design
7. **Adjacent context** - Nearby roads, sidewalks, and neighboring structures

## Exercise: Draw Your Site Plan

Now it's your turn. Using your grid paper and pencil, create a simple site plan for your dream home concept.

### Steps

1. **Draw the lot.** Start by sketching a rectangular property boundary. A good starting size is roughly 80 feet wide by 120 feet deep (that's 20 squares by 30 squares on 1/4" grid paper).

2. **Place the building.** Draw a simple rectangle representing your home's footprint somewhere on the lot. Think about how far it sits from the street and from the side property lines. Most residential codes require setbacks of at least 10-25 feet from property lines.

3. **Add a north arrow.** Draw a small arrow pointing toward the top or side of your page and label it "N." Decide where north is on your site. This determines where morning light (east) and afternoon light (west) will fall.

4. **Sketch the driveway and walkway.** Draw a driveway connecting the street to a garage or parking area. Add a walkway from the street or driveway to the front door.

5. **Indicate main views.** Use arrows or notes to mark the directions of any important views, such as a view toward mountains, a lake, or a garden.

6. **Add landscape elements.** Sketch a few circles for trees, note any garden areas, and consider how the landscape frames the approach to the home.

7. **Label everything.** Add labels for the street, driveway, walkway, front door, north arrow, and any significant features.

## Reflection

Look at your completed site plan and ask yourself: Does the building feel well-placed on the lot? Is there a clear and welcoming path from the street to the front door? Does the orientation take advantage of natural light and views? If not, sketch a second version and adjust. Iteration is part of the process.
