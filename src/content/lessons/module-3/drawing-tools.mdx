# Drawing Tools & Setup

Architecture begins with a pencil and a piece of paper. Before you can design a home, you need to learn how to represent your ideas through accurate, scaled 2D drawings by hand. In this lesson, you'll get familiar with the essential tools of architectural drawing and set yourself up for success as you begin sketching.

## Your Drawing Toolkit

You don't need an expensive setup to start drawing like an architect. Here are the basics you'll want to gather before moving forward:

### Grid Paper

Look for grid paper with 1/4-inch squares. This is the most common and useful grid size because it maps cleanly to the architectural scale of 1/4" = 1'0". Each small square on your paper represents one foot in the real world, which makes it intuitive to sketch rooms, walls, and furniture at a realistic size.

### Mechanical Pencil

A mechanical pencil with 0.5mm or thinner lead gives you the precision you need for clean lines and tight details. Wooden pencils work in a pinch, but mechanical pencils keep a consistent line width without constant sharpening.

### Eraser

A white vinyl eraser is your best friend. It removes graphite cleanly without smudging or tearing the paper. Avoid pink rubber erasers, which tend to leave marks and damage the surface of your sheet.

### Architectural Scale

An architectural scale ruler lets you measure and draw at specific ratios. For this course, you'll primarily use the 1/4" = 1'0" scale. If you don't have one yet, you can start with your grid paper as a guide, but an architectural scale becomes essential as your drawings get more detailed.

### Straightedge

A simple ruler or T-square helps you draw clean, straight lines. Pair it with your triangles for angled lines and consistent geometry.

### Triangle Set

Pick up a 45-degree triangle and a 30/60-degree triangle. These two tools let you draw vertical lines, angled walls, roof pitches, and consistent parallel lines quickly. They're fundamental to producing neat, professional-looking drawings.

### Compass

A compass is useful for drawing arcs, circles, and curved elements. You'll use it for door swings, rounded walls, and other curved geometry.

## The Right Mindset

Here is the most important thing to remember as you begin: this is not about perfection. Architectural drawing is about exploration. Your first sketches will be rough, and that is exactly how it should be.

Start by sketching freely. Let your pencil move quickly as you explore ideas, room arrangements, and spatial relationships. Don't worry about straight lines or perfect proportions in the early stages. The goal is to get ideas out of your head and onto paper where you can see them, evaluate them, and improve them.

Once you've landed on a direction you like, then you refine. Pull out the straightedge, measure with your scale, and tighten up the drawing. This two-step rhythm of loose exploration followed by measured refinement is how professional architects work, and it's how you'll work throughout this course.

Embrace iteration. Your best ideas will come from drawing something, seeing what works, adjusting, and drawing it again. Every line you put down teaches you something about the space you're creating.

## What's Next

With your tools assembled and your mindset calibrated, you're ready to start learning the language of architectural drawing. In the next lesson, you'll learn about line weights and conventions, the visual grammar that makes your drawings readable and meaningful to anyone who picks them up.
