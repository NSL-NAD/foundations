# Budget Checkpoint: Design Decisions

Every line you draw has a cost implication. Here are some design decisions that significantly impact budget.

## Expensive Design Choices

- Complex rooflines (each valley, hip, and transition adds cost)
- Custom window sizes and shapes
- Cantilevers and dramatic overhangs
- Multiple levels with varying floor plates
- Curved walls
- Very high ceilings (16'+ requires scaffolding, taller walls, more HVAC)

## Economical Design Choices

- Simple, rectangular footprints
- Standard window sizes from manufacturer catalogs
- Consistent floor-to-floor heights
- Gable or simple hip roofs
- Stacked plumbing (bathroom above bathroom)

## The Corners Rule

**The more corners your floor plan has, the more expensive it is to build.** A 2,000 sf square is cheaper than a 2,000 sf L-shape, which is cheaper than a 2,000 sf complex shape.

## Cost Reality

New custom construction typically runs **$200-$500+ per square foot** depending on location, complexity, and finish level. That "simple" 2,500 sf dream home is a $500K-$1.25M+ construction project before land.

Keep this in mind as you refine your drawings. Every design decision carries a price tag — some obvious, some hidden. The goal isn't to design the cheapest house possible, but to spend your budget where it matters most to you.
