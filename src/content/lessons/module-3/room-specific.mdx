# Rooms That Work: Key Planning Principles

Some rooms have functional requirements that go beyond general flow and proportion. Getting these right early prevents expensive changes later.

## Kitchen Design

### The Work Triangle

The relationship between your three primary work zones:

- **Refrigerator** (food storage)
- **Sink** (prep and cleanup)
- **Cooktop / Range** (cooking)

Classic guidelines:

- Each leg of the triangle: 4-9 feet
- Total triangle perimeter: 12-26 feet
- No leg should cross a major traffic path
- No obstacles (islands, tables) should intersect a leg

### Modern Adaptation

Today's kitchens often have multiple cooks and work zones. Consider:

- A prep sink separate from main sink
- Multiple work triangles for different cooks
- The "golden triangle" between cooktop, prep area, and trash or compost

### Kitchen Clearances

- 42" minimum between facing cabinets and appliances (48" better for two cooks)
- 36" minimum at ends of islands (not primary walkways)
- 15" minimum counter on one side of cooktop
- 24" minimum counter on one side of sink
- Dishwasher should open without blocking sink access

### Plumbing Considerations

- Sinks and dishwashers need drain access
- Island sinks require floor routing (expensive in slab construction)
- Gas cooktops need gas line routing
- Vent hoods need exterior exhaust path

## Bathroom Design

### Wet Wall Strategy

Plumbing is expensive. Grouping fixtures along shared walls minimizes cost:

- Back-to-back bathrooms sharing a wall
- Bathroom above bathroom (stacked plumbing)
- Kitchen and bathroom sharing a wall

### Fixture Clearances (Minimum Code)

| Fixture | Minimum Clearance |
|---------|-------------------|
| Toilet | 15" from center to side wall, 21" clearance in front |
| Sink | 4" from side wall, 21" clearance in front |
| Shower | 30" x 30" minimum interior (36" x 36" comfortable) |
| Tub | 60" x 30" standard; 15" clearance alongside |

### Comfortable Clearances (Recommended)

| Fixture | Recommended Clearance |
|---------|----------------------|
| Toilet | 18" from center to side wall, 30" clearance in front |
| Double vanity | 36" per sink minimum, 30" between sinks |
| Shower | 36" x 48" or larger for comfort |
| Door swing | Should not hit fixtures when opening |

### Ventilation Requirements

- Bathrooms need either a window (often minimum 3 sf) or mechanical exhaust
- Exhaust fans should vent to exterior (not into attic)
- Sizing: Minimum 1 CFM per square foot of bathroom

### Water Heater Distance

- The farther fixtures are from the water heater, the longer the wait for hot water
- Consider a recirculating system or point-of-use heater for distant bathrooms

## Bedroom Design

### Minimum Sizes (General Guidelines)

- **Master bedroom:** 12' x 14' minimum (14' x 16' comfortable with king bed)
- **Secondary bedrooms:** 10' x 10' minimum (11' x 12' comfortable)
- Code typically requires minimum 70 sf with no dimension under 7'

### Furniture Planning

- King bed: 76" x 80" (need roughly 10' width minimum for bed plus nightstands)
- Queen bed: 60" x 80" (need roughly 9' width for bed plus nightstands)
- Allow 36" clearance on at least two sides of bed (24" minimum one side)
- 36" in front of closet and dresser

### Egress Requirements

- At least one window meeting egress requirements (see Zoning and Code Basics lesson)
- Direct access to hallway leading to exit
- Bedroom doors: minimum 80" height, 32" width (36" better for accessibility)

### Closet Considerations

- Walk-in closets don't count toward minimum bedroom square footage in some jurisdictions
- Pocket doors or barn doors save swing space but reduce sound privacy
- Light switch location: inside door swing, 44" height

## Laundry Room

### Location Options

| Location | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Near bedrooms | Close to where laundry is generated and stored | Noise, potential water damage upstairs |
| Main floor or mudroom | Convenient, can handle dirty items at entry | Takes main floor square footage |
| Basement | Out of the way, water damage contained | Stairs with heavy loads |
| Garage | Noise isolated, easy ventilation | Climate issues, farther from living space |

### Space Requirements

- **Minimum:** 5' x 6' for side-by-side washer and dryer
- **Comfortable:** 6' x 8' adds folding space
- **Ideal:** 6' x 10' allows folding counter, hanging, and sorting

### Utility Needs

- Hot and cold water supply
- Drain (floor drain recommended if upstairs)
- 240V outlet for electric dryer or gas line
- Dryer vent to exterior (maximum length varies — shorter is better)
- Consider a utility sink

## Home Office

Post-2020, home offices deserve serious design attention.

### Minimum Size

8' x 10' for desk and minimal storage (10' x 12' comfortable)

### Considerations

- Video call background (what's behind you?)
- Natural light without glare on screens
- Sound isolation (solid core door, insulated walls)
- Dedicated circuit for equipment
- Internet and ethernet access
- Proximity to bathroom (avoiding walking through video frame)
