# Rooms That Work: Key Planning Principles

<DefinitionCard element="Work Triangle">
The Work Triangle is the imaginary triangle formed by a kitchen's three primary work zones — refrigerator, sink, and cooktop. When each leg measures 4-9 feet and the total perimeter stays between 12-26 feet, the kitchen flows efficiently.
</DefinitionCard>

Some rooms have functional requirements that go beyond general flow and proportion. Getting these right early prevents expensive changes later.

## Kitchen Design

### The Work Triangle

The relationship between your three primary work zones:

- **Refrigerator** (food storage)
- **Sink** (prep and cleanup)
- **Cooktop / Range** (cooking)

Classic guidelines:

- Each leg of the triangle: 4-9 feet
- Total triangle perimeter: 12-26 feet
- No leg should cross a major traffic path
- No obstacles (islands, tables) should intersect a leg

### Modern Adaptation

Today's kitchens often have multiple cooks and work zones. Consider:

- A prep sink separate from main sink
- Multiple work triangles for different cooks
- The "golden triangle" between cooktop, prep area, and trash or compost

### Kitchen Clearances

- 42 inches minimum between facing cabinets and appliances (48 inches better for two cooks)
- 36 inches minimum at ends of islands (not primary walkways)
- 15 inches minimum counter on one side of cooktop
- 24 inches minimum counter on one side of sink
- Dishwasher should open without blocking sink access

### Plumbing Considerations

- Sinks and dishwashers need drain access
- Island sinks require floor routing (expensive in slab construction)
- Gas cooktops need gas line routing
- Vent hoods need exterior exhaust path

## Bathroom Design

### Wet Wall Strategy

Plumbing is expensive. Grouping fixtures along shared walls minimizes cost:

- Back-to-back bathrooms sharing a wall
- Bathroom above bathroom (stacked plumbing)
- Kitchen and bathroom sharing a wall

### Fixture Clearances

**Minimum (code requirements):**

- **Toilet** — 15 inches from center to side wall, 21 inches clearance in front
- **Sink** — 4 inches from side wall, 21 inches clearance in front
- **Shower** — 30 x 30 inches minimum interior (36 x 36 inches comfortable)
- **Tub** — 60 x 30 inches standard; 15 inches clearance alongside

**Recommended (comfortable clearances):**

- **Toilet** — 18 inches from center to side wall, 30 inches clearance in front
- **Double vanity** — 36 inches per sink minimum, 30 inches between sinks
- **Shower** — 36 x 48 inches or larger for comfort
- **Door swing** — Should not hit fixtures when opening

### Ventilation Requirements

- Bathrooms need either a window (often minimum 3 sf) or mechanical exhaust
- Exhaust fans should vent to exterior (not into attic)
- Sizing: Minimum 1 CFM per square foot of bathroom

### Water Heater Distance

- The farther fixtures are from the water heater, the longer the wait for hot water
- Consider a recirculating system or point-of-use heater for distant bathrooms

## Bedroom Design

### Minimum Sizes (General Guidelines)

- **Master bedroom:** 12 x 14 feet minimum (14 x 16 feet comfortable with king bed)
- **Secondary bedrooms:** 10 x 10 feet minimum (11 x 12 feet comfortable)
- Code typically requires minimum 70 sf with no dimension under 7 feet

### Furniture Planning

- King bed: 76 x 80 inches (need roughly 10-foot width minimum for bed plus nightstands)
- Queen bed: 60 x 80 inches (need roughly 9-foot width for bed plus nightstands)
- Allow 36 inches clearance on at least two sides of bed (24 inches minimum one side)
- 36 inches in front of closet and dresser

### Egress Requirements

- At least one window meeting egress requirements (see Zoning and Code Basics lesson)
- Direct access to hallway leading to exit
- Bedroom doors: minimum 80 inches height, 32 inches width (36 inches better for accessibility)

### Closet Considerations

- Walk-in closets don't count toward minimum bedroom square footage in some jurisdictions
- Pocket doors or barn doors save swing space but reduce sound privacy
- Light switch location: inside door swing, 44 inches height

## Laundry Room

### Location Options

- **Near bedrooms** — Close to where laundry is generated and stored. Tradeoff: noise, potential water damage upstairs.
- **Main floor or mudroom** — Convenient, can handle dirty items at entry. Tradeoff: takes main floor square footage.
- **Basement** — Out of the way, water damage contained. Tradeoff: stairs with heavy loads.
- **Garage** — Noise isolated, easy ventilation. Tradeoff: climate issues, farther from living space.

### Space Requirements

- **Minimum:** 5 x 6 feet for side-by-side washer and dryer
- **Comfortable:** 6 x 8 feet adds folding space
- **Ideal:** 6 x 10 feet allows folding counter, hanging, and sorting

### Utility Needs

- Hot and cold water supply
- Drain (floor drain recommended if upstairs)
- 240V outlet for electric dryer or gas line
- Dryer vent to exterior (maximum length varies — shorter is better)
- Consider a utility sink

## Home Office

Post-2020, home offices deserve serious design attention.

### Minimum Size

8 x 10 feet for desk and minimal storage (10 x 12 feet comfortable)

### Considerations

- Video call background (what's behind you?)
- Natural light without glare on screens
- Sound isolation (solid core door, insulated walls)
- Dedicated circuit for equipment
- Internet and ethernet access
- Proximity to bathroom (avoiding walking through video frame)

## Exercise

<DrawerPath>

Review your floor plan and check each room against the guidelines in this lesson:

1. Verify kitchen clearances and work triangle dimensions
2. Check bathroom fixture clearances
3. Confirm bedroom sizes accommodate your intended furniture
4. Make sure laundry has required utility connections
5. Mark any violations in red and sketch corrections

</DrawerPath>

<BriefPath>

Write a **Room Functionality Audit** for your dream home:

1. Kitchen — describe your work triangle layout and verify clearance dimensions
2. Bathrooms — list each fixture and confirm adequate clearances
3. Bedrooms — note intended bed size and verify room dimensions work
4. Laundry — choose a location and justify why it works best for your household
5. Home office (if applicable) — describe the setup and any special requirements

## Design Note

The best room designs feel effortless — but that ease comes from careful attention to dimensions, clearances, and functional relationships. When a kitchen flows smoothly or a bathroom feels spacious, it's because someone measured carefully and designed with real use in mind.
